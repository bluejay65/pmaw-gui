1,CyberpunkGrappling,"Oh I didn't catch that it happened shortly after the Bas Rutten fight.

Honestly I don't think You should be pissed at anybody over the fact that Kohsaka never won the Openweight. (But I still understand your pain)

1) The title was only in Worked matches for about 18 months.

2) RINGS was a promotion that had trouble picking a good direction.

They managed to outdraw **Pancrase and Shooto** during it's entire time but with **Pride** coming it was going to be very difficult. And then you add Maeda to the mix who is a borderline maniac... mistakes were inevitable.

I should be angry that Tamura got buried because he's my hero but somehow... I'm not. I'm not because He managed to be very Successful in a period where we had guys like the **Three Musketeers** and the **Four Pillars**

Kohsaka is a different thing, I believe he made his debut 2 years too late but hey... from the 5 years he wrestled, he proved to be one of the greatest athlete in Shoot-Style History. That's a huge accomplishment in my eyes.

Years later he proved that he still got it with his matches in NJPW and U-STYLE. (Seriously his 2nd match with Nagata is great). 

He could have pursued a good PW career as a Main Eventer but he chose to stay in MMA.",1637963155,1,SquaredCircle
