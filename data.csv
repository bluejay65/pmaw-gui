1,CyberpunkGrappling,"Oh I didn't catch that it happened shortly after the Bas Rutten fight.

Honestly I don't think You should be pissed at anybody over the fact that Kohsaka never won the Openweight. (But I still understand your pain)

1) The title was only in Worked matches for about 18 months.

2) RINGS was a promotion that had trouble picking a good direction.

They managed to outdraw **Pancrase and Shooto** during it's entire time but with **Pride** coming it was going to be very difficult. And then you add Maeda to the mix who is a borderline maniac... mistakes were inevitable.

I should be angry that Tamura got buried because he's my hero but somehow... I'm not. I'm not because He managed to be very Successful in a period where we had guys like the **Three Musketeers** and the **Four Pillars**

Kohsaka is a different thing, I believe he made his debut 2 years too late but hey... from the 5 years he wrestled, he proved to be one of the greatest athlete in Shoot-Style History. That's a huge accomplishment in my eyes.

Years later he proved that he still got it with his matches in NJPW and U-STYLE. (Seriously his 2nd match with Nagata is great). 

He could have pursued a good PW career as a Main Eventer but he chose to stay in MMA.",1637963155,1,SquaredCircle

89,helvetica-,"I think even though this interview was only 3 minutes it has some great insights from NAF on the team dynamics that /r/GlobalOffensive has been non-stop speculating about. NAF looks pretty cheerful throughout the interview, hope TL can carry that through to the rest of the lower bracket!

Mostly complete transcript for those who can't watch the vid:

&gt; **INTERVIEWER:** How are you feeling right now?

&gt; **NAF:** Obviously, it feels really good to win, especially in front of a crowd again. Just playing in the arena, I just felt like all I could feel is just playing in front of all these fans. It's been so long, especially since the last time we played in front of a crowd was in late 2019. It's just amazing to play in front of all these fans, and of course the win is always nice.

&gt; **I**: *You played quite a good game here, especially here in Overpass with these clutch rounds. Do you feel like you get more pumped up for those wins?*

&gt; **N**: I just feel like at the end of the day, it's just my job on Liquid, to be that clutch player, that Perfecto/Xyp9x-type player. I felt like I was delivering with that, and I'm nothing but happy that I was able to fulfill the obligations I have to my team.

&gt; **I**: *Going into this tournament, everyone knows you're kind of a ""dead team"". This was a game you shouldn't have won, really. Can you explain how you managed to win this game?*

&gt; **N**: Like you said, we're somewhat of a ""dead team"". We don't have any pressure: all the pressure is on NIP. I don't know if they felt it there, but I remember after the first map, through the cameras I could see some of them stressing out and all that, taking deep breaths. We're all just like ""why are they stressing out so much? It's so crazy."" I guess obviously they should have won with our state. We haven't been practicing too much. But at the end of the day, shit happens, it's alright. We're 5 players who know how to play CS so it's nothing NIP should feel too bad about.

&gt; **I**: *Going into this tournament, you guys over the year have had quite a few problems with who's being the caller. How's it looking now?*

&gt; **N:** With how it is now we're mainly just leaving FalleN to do what he wants to do. Obviously with our team, we have personalities that want to chime in all the time. We're just saying: Hey guys. We're at the end of the road here. Let's just be calm. Let's just make sure FalleN can say what he needs to say. Let's have Stewie mid-game here and there. Let's just let EliGE say what he needs to say. At the end of the day, let's just let FalleN have his way.

&gt; **I**: *During all these rumors with the team, you've been one of the players that haven't been mentioned too much. How has your point of view been during this time?*

&gt; **N**: My position to the public is somewhat of a mystery. That's somewhat of a mystery that has yet to be revealed. I guess I got to leave it there.

&gt; **I**: *So the Stewie interview with HLTV had some harsh words to say about Grim, and he clarified those 
comments on Twitter.  How was the team dynamic? Was there any fighting after that?* 

&gt; **N**: No, but I do believe Stewie was a bit harsh. Stewie did apologize, and he knows what he said was wrong a bit here and there. But at the end of the day, he was just saying what he needed to say off his chest. He's apologized to Mike. We're all getting along at the end of the day, and that's all that matters.

The first  game ability is pretty standard manipulation, the second game is just a specialist application of manipulation. the copying memories onto memory cards, that bit is very similar to pakunoda's memory bomb bullets which does use conjuration. The final ability honestly seems a bit out of place with the other 2, very similar to the radar guy from Battera's greed island crew but mixed with Palm's ability post being turned into a soldier, it would need conjuration the most for its effect unless you went the route palm does which is assumed to be through use of emission. 

That being said I could see this being a manipulator using a real game console to do basically all of the same effects but it's definitely possible through conjuration as well, just seems kind of a waste that you make a conjured item to basically give you manipulator abilities",1637963153,1,HatsuVault

195,Romulus3799,"Well I'm glad you're open-minded. Wenwu was a man who came across immense power and used it to conquer and build an empire. But he fell in love, and that love was so powerful that he actually gave up everything he had built to start a family. That in itself is amazing, and something we don't often see in villains, let alone supervillains.

When his wife died, Wenwu was so lost that he went back to the only things he knew: conquest, violence. He forced his children into it, alienating them instead of being there for them when they needed him most. This was the worst thing Wenwu ever did to his children, but it doesn't make him evil. And years later, when he hears his wife calling to him, he does everything in his power to get her back. 

The moment that gave him incredible depth to me was when it was revealed the soul eaters lure people to Ta Lo using their greatest desires. Meaning Wenwu's *greatest* desire was to bring his family back together.

Despite all this, Wenwu still could've easily come off as a typical ""evil father"" character, but Tony Leung's outstanding performance conveys so much sympathy, sincerity, and warmth that despite everything Wenwu did, you can't really write him off.

That's what makes him my favorite MCU villain. Because he's not a villain at all.",1637963153,14,marvelstudios

230,TypicalPlantiff,"Again: a trial is supposed to prove ot a jury something. Whether the jury decides something doesnt mean its decision is the utmost epitome of truth. Just yesterday a person that killed multiple elder people got a mistrial: 11:1 on the jury. One jurist simply didnt want to convict him. That doesnt mean the government hand a weak case. They literally showed direct evidence of him selling property of the old people killed. 

Plenty of other times a jury reaches a decision thats wrong. The point is a trial attempts to show evidence of intent to a jury. And since we can access all evidence of most trials  and judge for ourselves - we can also decide on whether there is intent or not. All the evidence in thsi case OBJECTIVELY, not subjectively, absolutely OBJECTIVELY shows that William had no intent of murdering anybody. Even his charges betray that - he is guilty not of malicious murder but of FELONY MURDER. Which is the stupidest legal jujitsu. 

SO even the jury agreed there was no intent in the other two guys at least. But because of the stupid american ficiton of 'felony murder' they will be sentenced to life.

When progressives complain about the merger between the state and the prison system - this is it. The existance of felony murder and the fact its sentencing guidelines can be just as hard as 1st degree intentional murder.",1637963153,0,AskTrumpSupporters

343,High_Speed_Idiot,"&gt; And when we taxpayers pay off these student loans which rich banks are gonna pocket that?

There are certainly more ways to approach student loan forgiveness than just paying off the banks with taxpayer dollars. Not to mention the entire for profit student loan system needs to be dismantled and reworked from a human and societal perspective. Though I'd gladly take immediate student debt forgiveness immediately, without a restructuring of how higher education is paid for socially it'd just be a recurring issue.  

&gt;Still ends up being socialism for the rich.

God I wish this phrase would die. ""socialism for the rich"" is called capitalism, its been that way since Adam Smith pointed out corporations can buy favors from governments in a book he published in 1776. The state serving the interests of capital is a defining feature of capitalism.

&gt;Same with our stimulus checks, most of it went to VISA and Mastercard because people paid off debt because we are a debt based economy.

This is a great observation about how UBI and other schemes where the government simply gives out cash are absolutely not viable solutions to our current societal problems.",1637963152,9,ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM

Here is the relevant section: 
299 Television receivers and visual display units in motor vehicles
(1) A driver must not drive a motor vehicle that has a television receiver or visual display unit in or on the vehicle operating while the vehicle is moving, or is stationary but not parked, if any part of the image on the screen‚Äî
(a) is visible to the driver from the normal driving position; or
(b) is likely to distract another driver.

If the problem is you cannot ""feel"" your chest during a bench press, do a little chest isolation beforehand. Do some flies and get a pump and you will definitely feel your chest while benching.

If you want to switch to dips then do it, they are great. Is there any reason you haven't considered dumbbell benching? Just doing weighted dips into dumbbell bench you should feel your chest blow up.",1637963151,13,gainit

I used to work at a Domino's pizza, and two of our colleagues were killed, off shift, in an accident on a motorway. On the day it wasn't confirmed for a long time, but we (me and the manager, I was the first able to confirm it) told people on their own separately. Made sure those who were closest to them found out first, offered everyone the option to go home early, a few people stayed. 

The franchise owners paid for a grief counsellor to come to our shop every day for three weeks to talk to everyone, be there for mental support and just generally be around. They got the shop covered for both of the funerals, and made it clear that anyone who wanted to attend could have the day off paid. 

After the funerals, some of their friends started off trying to raise money for a memorial, the area manager organised to *double* what they had tried to raise, and give them that on top of the efforts.
