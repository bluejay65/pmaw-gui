            "body": "Hello!! So a tip that I do that really helps me manage my hair in general is this:\n1. Wash your hair at night (I let my hair air dry and to prevent damage from a blow dryer)\n2. Next morning, spray in some dry shampoo (I just use Batisse from Target - the yellow tropical scented one). This will give your hair texture and some grip for the braids. It will also allow you to go 2-3 days between washes because your hair won\u2019t get greasy.\n3. Start braiding (follow YouTube as suggested). I know I should write steps out here but honestly I\u2019m not a word person, but a visual person so I recommend that.\n4. Finish with a light hairspray. \n\nFinally, I just want to say to be easy on yourself. You\u2019re absolutely beautiful and just keep practicing. Have fun with it! \ud83d\ude18",

A few months ago I purchased it for the first time since I know so many people absolutely love it, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try. I must say the formula is great and gives really nice coverage; however, I ran into this issue where the concealer would be squeezed out the top of the part that pushes it down to force it up the tube to the sponge, causing a lot of product to get trapped and become inaccessible (without trying to completely take it apart haha).\n\nIs this a common issue people run into? Or is it just something wrong with the one I have? I wanted to hear from others about this so I can take that into account when considering repurchasing. Thanks! :)",

Kind of panicking here because I can\u2019t tell if I have a cold sore or not. \n\nSunday morning my lips were super dry (as always) so I periodically coated them in Vaseline (as always) only to notice that my upper right lip area had cracked and peeled and was tingly. \n\nWoke up Monday with the first pic - yellow scabby blister thing? Lip area around became red and was tingly all day. I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist told me it is a cold sore and to use Abreva. But the blister fell off and was gone by dinner time? And the lip skin beneath is smooth?\n\nToday (Tuesday) I woke up with nothing, just the tingle tingles and the lip area is still just a bit red and tighter than usual. \n\nIs this a cold sore? I thought they lasted several days? Not 24 hours? Or is it just the cracked lip that has begun to heal?\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: Sorry for my mustache hairs, I self-waxed my upper lip recently and missed quite a few :(",

I spray before I leave the house and I\u2019m good for 12hrs.

My hair is very frizzy and thick, but the perms are what kind of fixed it for me.  \nWhen I have a curly/wavy perm, I always have to let my hair air dry/blow dry it after washing it (like not sleeping on it wet haha), because it will be messy the next day if I don\u2019t.\nMy most recent perm lasted a reallyyyy long time.  I think maybe 2 years?  This might be because of my hair texture though (my sister has pin straight hair and hers lasted a little less than mine).\nAlso, I personally think my perm looks better after about half a year.  I guess more natural looking??\nI hope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello! Fellow \u2018too skinny\u2019 girl here.\n\nI second the person that recommended lowering your sodium intake. Also whatever healthy habits you enjoy, practice them consistently over this coming week. Knowing that you\u2019re putting in the effort to take care of yourself will help you feel and look happier and prettier. For me it\u2019s starting the day with healthy smoothies (nut butters and avocado provide wholesome healthy fats) and doing a couple blogilates videos. For the hair i would recommend a deep condition treatment. Either from the drugstore or with coconut or olive oil. My favorite easy makeup is a light mineral foundation, mascara and tinted lip balm. If you\u2019ll be in the water I feel that ruched/ribbed one-pieces Can suit our body type better than a bikini does. Just something to consider. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far I just want to encourage you to not be so hard on yourself over your body type! I used to feel so crushed when people would comment on my weight, asking if I was bulemic or if I had considered eating more. I even had a friend call me knobbly-kneed like freaking Harry Potter. I don\u2019t know your age but for me as I\u2019ve entered my mid twenties I care less about what others may think of my body type and just appreciate my little body for keeping me going this far lol. Your boyfriend obviously likes you as you are and will just be happy to spend time with you. Hope you have fun!",

Grad school has been tough, especially with trying to conduct research throughout a pandemic. \n\nFor those interested in an interview, I will be reaching out shortly to start scheduling for this weekend and the next several weeks to come. I will be interviewing to get to know you better as well as have a better understanding of your experiences. If I do not reach out to you in the next two weeks, I may reach out towards the end of October as I will need help with user testing on my prototype and I hope I can share some of your time then to get this project up and running! \n\nI will keep you guys updated on the project results :D Thank you again for all your help and support! I hope you and your loved ones all stay safe. With love.",

Granted, that is if you are taking care of your skin correctly. \n\nA good cleanser (make sure to double cleanse) moisturizer, and sunscreen should work well for most people. A good glycolic or salicylic acid cleanser should help if you need mild exfoliation along the way. \nIf you absolutely need an active, I'd start out with a good quality vitamin C serum.

            "body": "Hello dear!!\n\nThere are a few things to go over. \n\nFor amab people, their brow bone tends to be lower over the eyes and more prominent (and thicker) than those afab.  There is also a bit of difference in the forehead altogether. AMAB people to have more sloping foreheads while afab tend to be more vertical and rounded.   \nAs well, afab people tend to have thinner (less dense) and lighter eyebrow hair that usually has a distinct arch. AFAB will, usually, have their brow bone exposed at the peak of the arch and towards the end (think brow bone highlight). Meanwhile, most amab people will have their eyebrows covering their brow bone.   \n\n\nI HIGHLY suggest you watch videos like Cosmo Queen. The series shows very clearly how amab people construct more 'feminine' features. You'll notice a lot of the things I discussed, though it's a bit more exaggerated that what would be useful for everyday looks. They cover their eyebrows and then draw them higher and use a heavy brow highlight to imitate a brow bone. Highlight the forehead to make it more pronounced (to visually bring it forward).   \nI think there's a lot you can take and use from the videos to help you along your journey.   \n\n\nHope this helps!! \u2764",

It is the only FDA approved treatment for permanent hair REMOVAL. For example, when transgender folk get their genital surgery this is the hair removal they get to permanently destroy the follicles in their skin on their bikini/crotch before the surgery is done (because there\u2019s a lot of skin grafting in those procedures and they can\u2019t have active hair follicles growing on/in grafted skin). It is permanent.\n\nI am getting it done on my bikini at the moment and the results are fantastic after just a few sessions. It hurts like a mother but I have never felt smoother/sexier. I would recommend looking into this if you\u2019re serious about hair removal. You\u2019re just throwing good money after bad with the laser (most of the time. different lasers will likely produce better results in diff people) X",

I\u2019ve VERY careful with application and don\u2019t mind a small wrinkle, so I\u2019ve been really happy with them.\n\nAnd this is going to sound crazy but I\u2019ve also been using press on nails! (Hello 1995!). They\u2019ve come a long way from the press on nails of our adolescence! There are glue on types, and a kind with a built in adhesive - they both look great and feel super secure to me. Only downside with the adhesive type is that they start to lift a little after a few days so they\u2019re not super long lasting. But I recently had a glue on set for almost 2 weeks, only took them off b/c my real growth was showing. \n\nI used to get regular manicures, but that seems like an unnecessary trip during Covid times. I also have a 3yo and a 3mo so I never feel like painting them myself and waiting for them to dry. The strips and press ons have been great for me these last few months!",

            "body": "I had the same problem when I first started wearing blush! I have fair skin with pink leaning undertones, so whenever I wore pink or peach toned blush, my cheeks looked REALLY pink, and not in a good way lol. I discovered that orange and brown toned blushes look so much better on me because instead of just highlighting my pink undertones, they bring warmth to my skin and give me a more sunkissed, glowy look! I\u2019m not sure if going against your undertones is the proper makeup technique, but it works amazingly for me. Another thing you could do is watch how much you\u2019re putting on. I don\u2019t wanna waste my pink blush, so I just apply the tiniest amount and I always wear foundation or at least a skin tint underneath so it doesn\u2019t just look like I\u2019m adding to the unevenness of my skin tone. Placement helps too! I apply it higher up towards my temple and not so much directly on the apples of my cheeks to help contour my face. If I apply too much on my apples you look at my face and it\u2019s just like HELLO BLUSH and not much of anything else. I absolutely love orange blushes though! It seems counterintuitive cause like, no one blushes orange naturally, but they look much more fitting on me. Good luck!",

Well I can say that getting out of my previous relationship was the first step, it was a very toxic environment and next was doing and picking up activities that I loved, but stopped doing because of depression helped immensely. These include painting, sketching and exercise, they all kinda functioned as outlets and helped my self esteem. Also doing things by yourself like going to the movies, sitting down at a cafe and reading a good book while drinking coffee and occasionally treating yourself to little gifts from you to you gives a feeling of small fulfillments that make a positive difference in your day.

            "body": "Hello, dentist here who also has bruxism.\n\nHere's the vicious circle. You're stressed, you clench your jaw in your sleep because your brain needs a way out. That's temporal and masseter muscles doing that. Then you keep being stressed. Keep clenching your jaw. The more you clench your jaw, the more these muscles work, and the stronger they become. The stronger they become, the more you clench your jaw, and the stronger they become.\n\nThis needs to be stopped because of two very important reasons:\n1) The clenching erodes your teeth. I've seen people with 1/3rd left of their teeth because of this. It's aesthetically not pleasing, and it's literally your teeth eroding away.\n2) Our jaw joint is a crazy one. The only thing protecting the joint is One Disc in between two bones (mandibular bone and temporal bone) and when you clench your jaw, obviously, you also put a lot of pressure into this disc. Because you're literally pushing your mandibular bone upwards. In time, and this is a relatively short time, you will slowly misplace this disc, and then start eroding it a little. What you will experience first is there will be some pain. Then you will start hearing clicking when you open your mouth or when you chew. Then you will have a lot of pain when you chew. There is more to follow that if you don't get treatment for it. Right now, also because of underlying joint issues, my jaw joint does this thing where it momentarily displaces and then moves back into place. In time, my jaw might stop working completely.\n\nThe first time I was offered a nightguard was roughly six years ago. Different stuff happened and I wasn't able to get proper treatment so I just stopped looking for one, and now I'm here.\n\nWhat botox does is that it disables your muscle cells, so a bunch of your masseter muscle fibers will stop working for a few months. This will lead to these muscle fibers losing strength. Which will lead to less clenching and less damage and after a few appointments, you will have significantly reduced this damage taken.\n\nNow I'm sure it's expensive, because botox is a bit expensive. I don't know what the condition of your muscles are. In some cases, a botox treatment is extremely crucial, because the muscles are already really big and strong. We use botox first, and after a few months we switch to botox and nightguard, in those cases. In some cases, a nightguard is given and then the patient will be followed to see if there is improvement. Your dentist is the one to decide that.\n\nIn addition, what a nightguard does is that it moves your mandibular bone just a bit further away from the joint disc, so when you clench, there's less pressure on it. It also protects your teeth from eroding. So it doesn't stop the clenching, it's just a protective measure. In most cases that's enough. In my case, I clench so bad I break my nightguards.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions, ask away!\n\nEdit: botox on your masseter muscle, if done correctly, won't affect your expressions because it's not a muscle that has any role in facial expressions.",

            "body": "Hello fellow former nail biter!\n\nSo everytime a question like this comes up I race to recommend my holy trail product, not only because it works but also because I was suspicious af before I tried it and almost didn't.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutra-Nail-5-To-7-Day-Growth-with-Calcium-and-Protein-Nail-Treatments-0-45-oz/10451743 \n\n(Sorry for ugly link, I'm on mobile)\n\nI used to get it on Amazon but it's not as consistently stocked anymore. Anyway, you apply it 3 times a day, which I found to be the tipping point where you really see results. It takes about 5-10 minutes to soak in so it's a bit of a commitment, but you can carefully use a computer or phone during. And you need to apply it thickly, I would fully load the brush for each nail and make sure to go over the entire nail including cuticle. \n\nHonestly I have no idea if it has any effect on growth speed, I don't think so? But it noticeably improves nail strength/hardness. I mean we're nail biters, we know exactly how hard our nails are from chomping them, and using this 100% makes them harder.\n\nAnother tip is don't fight with the bottle when it gets low, just set it aside and get another one. When the second one gets low, take the first and pour it into the second. Viola, usable again.",

            "body": "Hello. I was in Mexico when my adult teeth were coming in. When they did come in, my front teeth were stained a very dark yellow. My dentist believed it was the fluoride in the drinking water found in Mexico, the condition is also known as \u201cfluorosis\u201d my case was considered extreme. After years of bullying and crying to my parents about it I had my teeth fixed as a sophomore in high school. I first had to straighten my teeth which took about two years but I didn\u2019t mind because the brackets covered most of the stains. After that my dentist whitened my teeth, or at least tried to. The stains were still very prominent so she ended up having to shave my stained teeth down and then applying bonding on top of them. It was a long costly process but I am very grateful to my parents for it. My life and confidence since then changed dramatically. I know veneers might also be an option but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s even more expensive. Best of luck.",

Causing the tea tree to build up and cause more irritation. Like some have mentioned,  for dry scalp I use Head and Shoulders Deep Conditioning Shampoo and Conditioner. Again I only wash my hair maybe once or twice a week. Make sure to condition only the ends and mid shaft of your hair with a Leave-in conditioner after you shower. It will leave your hair nice and smooth while giving your roots room to breathe. I hope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello, fellow Eastern European :)\n\nAlcohol damages the natural protective barrier of your skin, leaving it more fragile and dehydrated. If it is the primary ingredient of the remedy you have, I\u2019d not recommend using it.\n\nResearch shows that you will get much better results with chemical exfoliation. Products with BHA and AHA can be real game changers. Topical retinoids are harsher but can be even more effective. \n\nYou should look for estheticians or dermatologists that use these principles in their practice. It is a sign that they keep up with the latest trends in dermatology. Asking them about their opinion on sun protection also is a good competence test. If they do not take this issue seriously, it is a red flag. I think that finding a competent specialist is the best scenario because they will know what to do, and you\u2019re likely to see the results quickly.\n\nDepending on the seriousness of your problem and your desire to process new information and take risks, you can learn about this stuff on your own and create your own skincare routine. R/skincareaddiction may be a good starting point.\n\nAlso, stay away from doctors who recommend detox.",

            "body": "As a HEAVILY depressed autistic person, I'm the same! My method is to add one thing at a time. \n\nWhen I wake up every morning I have to pee, so as I'm washing my hands afterwards I force myself to brush my teeth. I found that making it accessible really helped; instead of having my toothbrush in a cabinet, I got something that hangs on my mirror (it grosses me out when my toothbrush is just in the open air because when you flush the toilet, particles go everywhere. This grossout factor was ANOTHER thing preventing me from brushing \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nThen after brushing once in the morning was more of a habit, I started forcing myself to brush before I went to bed. I can't sleep without chapstick because my lips get really dry, so I put my chapstick in the bathroom to lure myself in there, then I guilt myself into brushing.\n\nWhen that felt more routine I worked on showering more often, which is hard for me because while the shower itself is great, I have sensory issues around being OUT of the shower and still being damp. To tackle this I leave a towel for myself in the bathroom so I can't forget it, and I set up a cozy spot away from my bed (wet pillowcase is the WORST) where I can lay my hair out to dry, which keeps it away from my body and makes it a little easier to bear. I reward myself with something really good to enjoy while my hair dries: A favorite snack, 30 minutes of reading a great book, whatever. \n\nThe point is, treat your depression like a wild animal that lives with you and that you have to work around. Leave traps for it. Be prepared for its inevitable victories; forgive yourself for those. Keep in mind that the depression won this battle, but it will lose the war. Know your enemy's method of attack and prepare for it:\n\nCan't get out of bed? Nightstand contains snacks that leave minimal crumbs, sealed in Tupperware to prevent bugs. \nCan't bring yourself to shower? Sanitary wipes for your pits and genitals are a lifesaver. I have baby wipes 'cause I'm real sensitive.\nCan't eat? Snacks like peanuts, dry cereal, chips, etc are key. Tell yourself you only have to eat one. That wasn't so bad. Think you can handle five? What about ten?\nOvereating? Separate your food into portions. Small ones. Force yourself to take only one at a time. When you finish it, see if you can wait five minutes before going to get the next one. Or even one minute, and then you can work your way up.\n\nThe best asset you can have is someone who's willing to check on you. Who's kind to you and allows you to backslide and screw up, but isn't an enabler. If you don't have a person like that, BE THAT PERSON. Schedule little events in your phone. \n\nReminder: Have you showered today? \n\nReminder: It's cool to be full of a billion cells that are all working to keep you alive. All those cells think you're worth something. They don't care about your GPA or the size I'd your paycheck or whatever. They deserve a reward. Drink a small cup of water.\n\nReminder: No matter how much of a piece of shit you think you are, dogs you pass on the street still strain on their leashes to say hello to you because they want to meet you and be your friend SO BADLY, and that's worth something. \n\nReminder: Brush your teeth! One minute per row! That's only ten seconds per section! Brushing your teeth is the only time you clean your skeleton! That's kind of cool!\n\nReminder: Fresh sheets are so incredibly blissful. Wash one pillowcase at a time, I don't care, but try to wash your sheets today! \n\nReminder: Washing your face is annoying, but it's fun to draw little smiley faces in the soap before you rinse. Just a thought :)\n\nWhen no one was there for me, I learned how much I love and appreciate myself. Everyone you know will let you down sometimes, and that's okay! You'll let them down too, and that's also okay! But that means YOU have to be there for you. Even if you feel like it doesn't matter or you're not worth it, thinking of yourself as your best friend who you're kinda mad at or disappointed in but who you still love and want to be happy, is your BEST weapon. Even if you can only do the bare minimum, your best friend is worth any effort you can give, even if it's eating five peanuts and drinking a cup of water. The more tiny things you do, the better you'll feel, and then you can do bigger things, like starting to work out and learning how to do something new and finishing old projects that have been collecting dust for years. Recovery isn't a destination, it's a journey, and every single step counts!",

For the cuticle serum:\n\n1 teaspoon of coconut oil - (I use the Virgin kind, I melt it in the microwave) coconut oil is great for not only growing your nails but making them strong\n\n1 teaspoon of jojoba oil - great for nourishing nails and repairing damaged collagen inside the nail bed \n\n3 drops of tea tree oil - antifungal to keep your nails from infection\n\n3 drops of vitamin E oil - moisturizes the nails and cuticle, also prevents yellowing of the nails if you paint them a lot! \n\nI give these oils a good mix and put it in one of those travel containers you usually put your eye creams on. I apply it three times a day. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello, I have a contrasting idea as I don\u2019t recommend IPL as they won\u2019t really have long term results in shortest amount of time. What I did was to get a package of DIODE LASER for 8 sessions. It has dramatically improved my pits, I can testify. About 80-90% stoppage of hair growth on my 8th session. I availed another 8 sesh package for the remaining 10-20% of hairs which grows/shows-up obviously only after 3-6 months. Today, my last session (9th session) was December last year and I only have around 25 strands or so of visible hair. And they\u2019re not the thick ones like they used to be. \n\nThe diode laser has higher frequency which the derma uses and increases per session. The recommendation was to return every 5 weeks for the next session to occur. And the procedure last around 45 mins. \n\nIt\u2019s a better investment for me with real results. Rather than spending on an IPL DIY which 1. May be expensive 2. May not work 3. May damage your skin further as not all equipments are calibrated/users qualified to do it.\n\nHope you find your best pit solution. Good luck. \ud83d\ude42",

            "body": "Hello, I agree with the other posters - gently exfoliate beforehand (a washcloth/loofah will do it, or one of those gorgeous DIY suggestions someone made. Sugar, salt or fresh coffee grounds mixed with coconut oil or even any body lotion you have lying around is fine), and then every couple of days. I stress please do this gently!!  \n\nYou'll definitely get faster with time :) Take it really slowly for now though, especially around your knees and ankles. I recommend trying one of the razors with a solid lotion attached around the blade. You don't even then really need to use any gel or anything then and it is way harder to cut yourself so you can move more confidently /quickly. But if you want a bit of extra lubrication you just need something cheap - shampoo, conditioner or a light body lotion is ideal.\n\nDefinitely moisturise afterwards, and every day - this will probably have the most impact. Great if you can use a lotion with tea tree oil as that is soothing &amp; antibacterial &amp; will help with any ingrown hairs that may come about. Though if you follow the routine of gentle exfoliation every 2-3 days, and moisturise daily, you should avoid any issues! Good luck!! \n\nI'm an ex beauty therapist and in general I really believe in waxing legs as a) someone else does it for you and b) it lasts longer. But I wouldn't try that til you're a bit older. It hurts at first and can be quite confronting. Just try to be patient...as with everything, practise makes perfect!! You'll get there!",

Been self tanning for about 7 years so I feel I can speak to this.\n\nTips: \n\nShowering: \n I shower every day and I use a gentle soap, Dove Sensitive.  No loofah or scrubbing. The first time you shower after tanning you\u2019ll rinse away the initial base coat and after that every shower it\u2019ll gradually fade.  If you have a good brand it won\u2019t fade much after sweating.\n\nFace:\nI do self tan my face as I like the way my face looks with color on it when I\u2019m not wearing makeup.\n\nMoisturizing:\nkeeping yourself moisturized helps extend the tan.  There\u2019s \u201ctan extending\u201d lotions you can buy but I just use my trusty ol coconut oil.  \n\nThis is my routine: \n\n-exfoliate entire body with OGX Sensitive + Rose Quartz and Pink Salt Body Scrub and exfoliating mitt \n-shave \n-exfoliate again \n-rinse with Dove Sensitive Body Wash\n-gently dry off with towel \n-apply coconut oil with skin that is still somewhat damp/moist from the warm shower \n-apply Bondi Sands Light/Medium self tanning mousse with a self tanning mitt (bought from Amazon) \n-let myself dry a bit\n-apply a second coat of the self tanner \n-let myself dry \n-go to bed in either all black loose clothing I don\u2019t mind getting tan on or just my black satin sheets (hehe \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4a) \n-shower off the next day with Dove Sensitive Body Wash again, paying close attention to the underarm area as I find if you don\u2019t the \u201cDHA Self Tan\u201d scent can linger, not pleasant \n\nI have used quite a few different brands (Jergens, LOreal, St Moriz, Vita Liberata, Fake Bake, St Tropez for many many years, and now Bondi Sands).  BS is my favourite of them all.  Reason being it is cheaper than ST, but equally good quality if not better, as I find it doesn\u2019t fade as weirdly as ST does.  Also St Moriz is quite good and cheaper BUT the smell for me was just awful.  BS the smell isn\u2019t as bad.\n\nAlso, I want to make a point that this routine seems like it\u2019s extensive and yes it is indeed time consuming, however I personally enjoy spending the time and use it as part of my \u201cself care\u201d routine.   I find it relaxing honestly, I usually light some candles and play some relaxing music and just kind of lay out and chill while I\u2019m waiting to dry and take the time before bed to relax.  In order for my tan to be how I like it I do the whole routine weekly.  I touch up the tan about every 3-4 days, and that\u2019s with moisturizing every day as well. \n\nHoped this helped ! Good luck \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

            "body": "Hello! First, using toner + 20 volume might not work too well. Toner in general isnt good for lightning as its deposit-only color. Now, it has technically lightened my hair with 20 vol in past experiments keeling it on for a while, but my hair lightens crazy easy so its not a good judge of \"normal\". If you want absolute surety that itll turn out lighter, use bleach again. Id deep condition it today. And as long as its still healthy and strong, Id bleach it tom (without touching the roots with bleach or waiting till last 5 min so you dont get hotroots) --&gt; then use toner + volume 10 developer --&gt; then use conditioner, and not wash hair for at least 3 days afterwards. \n\nThere is not set timeframe for whem you can bleach or dye hair. However, just make sire your hair can take a bit more damage and still feel healthy. Whether thats 1 hour or 5 months. If it need a lot of moisture or some protein consider focusing on damage control and then color.  Oh and purple shampoo/conditioner are just used for maintenance, they wont actually change/fix your hair color. Id save your money for more toner in a few month's touch-up. Good luck!",

It's like people feel like they are obligated to be like, \"Hello gorgeous!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\" Or \"Beautiful \u2665\ufe0f\" or whatever whether they actually think that or not. Honestly sometimes I just don't feel like I need to be validated for my appearance in this particular way, which is super generic and non-specific. It seems so fake. I would honestly rather hear something like \"wow you look so confident!\" or \"your hair looks really nice!\" Because at least it's something about me as a person. When guys post pics of themselves it's more likely to be their friends making dumb jokes or whatever. And honestly I would rather hear that than anything. I think the assumption is that every female has self esteem completely based on her physical beauty so if you tell her she's pretty/hot/beautiful/cute you are building her up. But we can have self esteem based on talent and taste in media and sense of humor and creativity too, just like guys.",

This is just my opinion and I'm up for a healthy discussion as I am also very curious.\n\nI work in the beauty industry and I've been here for a quite a while to know why the beauty industry is so successful.\n\nFor some women, I mean, sometimes, even I would admit to this, there are times when there is an emotional need we need to fill that only feeling pretty can fix. Even if it's not really the solution to my problem.\n\nIf i feel down because of a family issue, I turn to a salon to get a haircut or what not. \n\nAlso, the media is so manipulative. You know how they say that even the girl in the magazine, doesn't look like the girl in the magazine? It's true. I work a lot with ads as well and when we do people's makeup, they still find a way to make these models look even better than they do in real life and it sets such an impossible standard. \n\nI know, it's all in my perception. But sometimes, I can't help but also feel inadequate because I am not as pretty as them. And as a cult, women just try to empower each other by saying that we are all beautiful and gorgeous and what not so we don't feel like we are inadequate. \n\nI hope that makes sense. There's so much more to discuss. but I hope this helps.",

            "body": "Drink lots of water! I have an app that reminds me to drink water every 2 hours (but I try to drink water every hour). **1. SKIN:** I noticed a difference in my skin's health - Drinking lots of water along with a good skin routine works wonders. My lips are soft and plump and my face livens up when I keep well hydrated. **2. DIGESTIVE HEALTH:** Water improves digestive health (it keeps things moving along, helping with constipation) which I have been experiencing and loving. Your bowels NEED water to function properly. **3. WEIGHT LOSS:** Drinking lots of H2O increases your body's metabolism which aides in losing weight. You also lose weight if you replace sugary drinks with water (hello, ZERO calories!). Make sure to drink water about half hour before meals because it can prevent overeating (guilty) by making you feel full sooner. **4. SECRETIONS:** Your body needs water in order to produce saliva (which is 99% water, helps us digest our food, and keeps the mouth moist) and mucus (which keeps nose and eyes moist, helping against friction). **5. ORAL HEALTH:** Water helps keep the mouth clean. When water is consumed instead of sugary drinks, it can reduce tooth decay. Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities and make your teeth stronger.\n\nThere are soooo many more benefits of drinking water, so I encourage you to do some research and be amazed :)\n\nMake sure you look up a water intake calculator online to find out what your daily intake should be (usually based on your age, gender, height, and weight). Too much water is bad for you, so you want to be right in that sweet spot.",

            "body": "Hello! You sound like you, personally, aren't that interested in makeup and instead are looking to wear it to stop those comments. That makes me really upset on your behalf, first of all they are wrong for making those comments and second of all you should never wear makeup for someone else, makeup is great but you should only wear it because you like it and want to wear it.\n\nWhat I would suggest instead, is look into skincare. Learning about your skin (the type it is, what works for it and what doesn't) will pay dividends later in life. Also, I would suggest you respectfully ask why they care. Don't be rude, don't get sassy, just say it like \"I actually like my face :) Why would I want to change it?\" Hopefully one or both of these suggestions will get them off your back, which I think is your main goal. The second suggestion would be considered \"standing up for yourself\" which is another thing that's great to learn how to do as it will pay off later in life.\n\nFor reference, I am in my twenties and I wear makeup maybe once or twice per month. I love my skincare routine, its really simple (I am lazy lol) and I like how it makes my skin look.",

I also really like the Simply Protecting Moisturizer with SPF. The Citrus Day Gel is what i bought to replace the Garnier Skin Active Moisture Rescue Gel and if you couldn't find the Earth to Skin I'd recommend the Garnier one. All of those can be found at Walmart and probably other places but I always grab mine when I'm at Walmart. \n\nMakeup: \n\nEssence Super Last liquid liner or any Essence liquid liner. Their mascaras are good too even though I don't have any currently. \n\nNyx Bare With Me foundation, Hydratouch primer, On The Rise Volume Mascara, and the Perfect Filter shadow palettes are awesome. Also pretty much any of the Soft Matte Lip Cremes are amazing. And their setting sprays are pretty good too, especially the dewy one. \n\nBert's Bees All Aglow Lip &amp; Cheek sticks are my favorite blushes ever if you like cream blush but the E.L.F studio blush is great if you like powder. \n\nRevlon Super Lustrous Lipsticks are amazing, the formulas are all pretty good no matter if its matte or satin finish, they're pretty cheap and there's like a billion colors to choose from. \n\nCovergirl CGSmoothers is my favorite BB cream, I think its the perfect ratio of feeling like there's nothing there at all to tint of color. Its also pretty sweatproof and my go to for outdoor activities that I still want to wear makeup to. \n\nWet and Wild eyeshadow primer is fantastic, no creasing or loss of color and it stays all day, and their Hello Halo liquid highlighters are really good. The applicator for the highlighters is kinda stupid (giant doe foot, why is it so big) but the formula itself is great. Also the E.L.F. jelly highlighter is awesome, very pretty and buoldable and also fun to touch. \n\nAlso Simply has really good makeup remover wipes and miscellar water.",

            "body": "Hello! Before I go into advice, I just wanna say that were a little bit mislead these days about what our skin and our makeup is supposed to look like. All the porcelain skin and perfect foundation we see online is most definitely face tuned, because it's impossible to look like glass as a human being. \n\nSecondly, I would look into a better foundation and primer. You didn't mention the brand which you were using but if you're looking for a good dewy foundation I would recommend wet n wild, loreal, Maybelline, elf, and nyx as good places to start for drugstore and my personal favorite dewy foundation is the fenty hydrating foundation!\n\nYou will want to focus more on creams and balms instead of powders for your blush, contour, and highlighting, and a good dewy setting spray is also a great key!\n\nIf you don't feel like getting a new foundation, you could mix some moisturizer in with your bb cream and that might help! As for not using a beauty blender or brush, listen to your derm, but if it's making you unhappy you could always use a brush or blender and clean it extremely well before and after use. \n\nHope this helped!!!",

I am sorry to tell you; there is no up side here, it\u2019s all around a bad idea\n\nAnd yes, there are bacteria everywhere. That\u2019s why we typically distinguish between good and bad bacteria. In this case, I was clearly talking about bad bacteria, the kinds you do NOT want on your face. I dIdn\u2019t think I needed to specify. \n\nA loofah is NOT a gentle method of scrubbing one\u2019s face!!!! If she talked about using this on the body, I honestly wouldn\u2019t care as much because the skin on the body is thick, can withstand mechanical scrubbing and is less likely to breakout from bacterias. The skin on the face on the other hand is very thin. A loofah is too harsh for the face. I honestly don\u2019t know anyone who uses a loofah on their face. \n\nUsing your clean hands and fingers is actually more environmental friendly. \n\nI am not being negative. I hate bad beauty advice, especially bad skin care advice. I wish someone would have told me these things in my teen years when I first became interested in skincare. So if one 16 year old reads this and learn something about skincare, I would sleep better tonight. \n\nIt may seem to you that you\u2019re supporting \u201csomeone\u2019s talent\u201d but at the end of the day bad skincare advice is more harmful, it can ruin people\u2019s skin, their self-esteem, cause dysphoria...and so on. This is a bad idea. If you want to support her, by all means buy it, as a gentle cloth for a baby, to wash your body..etc. but please do not use on your face. That\u2019s all.",

I use tampons, but during heavier periods i dont go a lot on those either. The prospect of changing/refreshing only twice per day sounds brilliant.  Also how you all have described things have really taken my horrified feeling away.\nI think i might sound silly,  but just the other day, i had a bad experience with tampons.  I was quite upset at the prospect of having to use pads in future.\nYour comments have made me feel so much better is what im trying but failing, to explain briefly! \ud83d\ude01\nThankyou all very much \nI wish you all a wonderful day. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "body": "Ok here are my guesses: the shampoo seems like it could be harsh...like, really harsh. The ammonium laureth sulfate: harsh. Sea salt: harsh, like has no business being in shampoo. Lemon/lime/orange oil: essential oils especially lemon can be harsh in direct contact with skin.\n\nFor whatever reason I can't find the conditioner you're talking about. Is it the Herbal Essences Hello Hydration?\n\nI will say this from your shampoo: my guess is that you're completely stripping all moisture and oils and hydration from your hair and scalp. That can tend to make your scalp \"freak out\" and produce MORE oil, regardless of what conditioner you use. And chances are, the conditioner could have a lot of ingredients that coat the hair follicle and really weigh the curl down.\n\nI'm no expert, but my suggestion is that you use a far gentler shampoo. At first it may seem like your scalp is producing more oil but that's because your skin has to adjust to the shampoo not completely stripping it away. In the meantime, I would still take it easy and not wash it more than you're currently doing now. You can use dry shampoo, or even baby powder to absorb the extra oil in the meantime. I would then use a fairly light conditioner. One that doesn't necessarily coat the hair but will still moisturize.\n\nHope this can be a good starting point!",

When you apply dont forget about your neck and chest. \n\nALWAYS fill in your eyebrows before you do any kind of tweezing!!! This will stop you from over doing it. Personally, I like to keep my eyebrows quite natural so I use Benefit Gimme Brow. The applicator is a little brush that you run through your brows to brush and hold the hairs in place and it leaves a bit of colour to make them a bit more even and full. Even if you don't want to wear alot of makeup doing your eyebrows gives you a more polished and put together look. \n\nWhen applying eyeliner or mascara hold a mirror at mouth level. This causes your eyelids to be down and nearly closed without tugging on the delicate skin of your eyes (hello wrinkles!!) \n\nBeauty blender sponges (or the cheaper dupes) are amazing for blending concealer/foundation. Just wet, squeeze excess water and use a bouncing motion rather than smearing\n\nMakeup is like painting a picture, take a step back  and look at it as you go to make sure it's even and applied where you want. It can be used as a subtle enhancement or turn you into an optical illusion lol honestly it depends what kind of look you're wanting to go for but I'd love to help. Feel free to dm me \ud83d\ude0a",

            "body": "Face wipes are convenient, but really not great for taking off makeup. With that said, I would recommend looking up Susan Yara from Mixed Makeup. She\u2019s the one who made me aware of the double cleanse method, and it totally saved my eyelashes! Her YouTube videos are very skincare oriented, but I would HIGHLY recommend watching her double cleanse video and maybe some of her skincare reaction videos :) personally, I use micellar water across my entire face as my first step. Once I\u2019m in the shower, I use a pea-sized drop of pond\u2019s cold cream and gently rub it across my eye makeup. The cold cream is mostly mineral oil, so I try to avoid using it across my entire face to limit breakouts. (I also like Clinique\u2019s take the day off balm cleanser, but it has a slightly higher price tag). I allow the oiliness to break down my makeup (even works with waterproof!) and rinse it off, checking by using a white wash cloth to make sure nothing remains. I follow up by using a gently foaming cleanser by either Cetaphil or CeraVe to remove the micellar water and any remaining cold cream from my entire face and eye region. And then I follow up with a gentle moisturizer to reduce the likelihood that the foaming soap stripped my skin! For this technique, being in the shower really helps keep it mess-free,  but it\u2019s also totally doable over a sink. I would recommend keeping makeup wipes for emergencies where washing just isn\u2019t gonna happen (hello late nights!) and to remove eyeshadow fallout before moving onto your face makeup. Hope this helps!!",

            "body": "Hello! First if all - Don\u2019t worry. Hair growth on various parts of your body is perfectly normal - i cannot stress how normal it is actually!! . We actually grow hair all over our body and it just looks/feels different depending where it is growing. It may also be affected by hormones and as part of your bodies normal progression through life. Most women have random hairs that pop up all over the place - you most definitely are not alone in this - its just not something we talk about that often in my experience. Its clear that it bothers you though, so in the first instance i would recommend adopting a hair removal schedule that works for you - for example checking and removing hair from areas that bother you each week, while doing leg/underarm/bikini hair maintenance as normal. A more expensive option is too look at laser hair removal.  But it is uncomfortable, expensive and you need multiple sessions and top up sessions - so is a long term commitment. There is also polycystic ovary syndrome - which can cause excess bodily hair growth - so if you look at the symptoms of that and feel you match - i would recommend going to your dr to get that investigated.  Lastly - advertising, the beauty industry, porn, male demands etc. has meant that hair on women has been removed artificially for many years now - to the point that it is seen as an anomaly when we grow it! It isn\u2019t - it is normal and natural, it is not dirty or manly. Pubic hair actually helps protect your vulva and vagina. Many women are now ditching hair removal altogether now. So - you do you - but don\u2019t worry!!",

            "body": "My holy grail was First Aid Beauty's Hello Fab Triple Protection Skin Tint. But its been discontinued. It had medium coverage and a natural finish. I have 3 left in my stash, but am already on the hunt for what will replace it when I'm out.... Ive tried a couple new ones so far and this is what Ive found:\n\nNote: I have normal/lightly oily on the t zone skin and I prefer a natural finish, not too matte, but also not dewy shiny. So my opinions are based on that. Also, I lightly brush a translucent setting powder on my face after using a tint to lock it in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlossier Skin Tint : Not enough coverage for my slight redness, and I'm not a fan of the dewy finish. This may be good for people with dry skin, that want minimal coverage. Also didn't stay on very long.\n\nit Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream with SPF 50+ : Medium/full coverage, less than a foundation but not too sheer. It doesn't have as natural of a finish as Id like, more on the dewy side (not not as dewy as the glossier tint). This product comes in an oil free matte version as well, but that one was too drying/matte for me. The matte one may be a good option for people with oilier skin. Random note : I work on commercial sets, and frequently ask MUAs what their favorite skin tint is, any of the 3 it Cosmetic tints are the most common ones they suggest.\n\nPhilosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar Skin Tint : Medium/light coverage. Silky texture with a natural finish. It feels like a moisturizer on your skin. I would say its good for almost all skin types, but if your skin is very oily, it may not stay put all day.\n\nNYX Professional Makeup Bare with Me Tinted Skin Veil : Light coverage, and I found it to be thick and oily on my skin. Probably good for people with dry skin and want light coverage. This was my least favorite as someone who likes a natural finish.\n\nNo7 Dual Action Tinted Moisturizer SPF 15 : Medium/light coverage. It was very hydrating but not oily. It didn't have staying power for my day though, so I returned this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are SO many skin tints/tinted moisturizers out there - I'm still on the search for something as good as what I had before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.self.com/gallery/best-bb-creams-tinted-moisturizers](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-bb-creams-tinted-moisturizers)[https://www.byrdie.com/best-drugstore-bb-creams-4165883](https://www.byrdie.com/best-drugstore-bb-creams-4165883)\n\nHeres some more recommended ones I haven't tried yet. I'm looking forward to trying the La Roche Posay and NARS ones from these websites recommendations.",

I got a spray tan in 2003, but they were new and mine was orange! Ugh! Also moisturizing with Bio Oil for scars and it really cuts the dryness and invest in a good body cream. \n\nSkincare! Exfoliation with AHA and my Amour Pacific enzymes. Tons of moisture with German Nivea. Retinol. Argireline. Water (but I drink over a gallon per day anyway), masks...sheet and my Hello Honey! strawberry honey mask for moisture. A week before, a professional facial. I don't think I need acid resurfacing as my skin is actually pretty good for 45. My skin is sensitive, I try not to overdo. \n\nNails! I'd get pink gels. Before I just got a manicure on natural nails, Jewel of India OPI. I'd get them a few days before, not same day! It was Black Friday, too crowded! Anxiety inducing. Pedicure, last time I got my favorite pedicure shade, Pompeii Purple, OPI. Before I'd massage Bio Oil in my hands everyday, a few times a day, I call it my youth serum, lol. \n\nDiet and exercise is definitely most important. I was on Lexapro in 2003, a medication I definitely shouldn't be on. I got a DNA medication test in 18\" and Lexapro came up as incompatible. I gained 30 pounds and first time in my life (i was 29) was over 125. I'd consume less carbs (I'm type one diabetic anyway) and exercise five days a week, weight training and cardio. Yoga for relaxation. \n\nI'd do my makeup myself,  like I did for my wedding. Just lots of trial and error from YouTube tutorials. I did lashes for my reunion, maybe again, but practice more this time? I'm really bad at lashes despite lots of tutorials. \n\nOutfit, really, really good undergarments. I bought a full length Spanx type corset thing from Bloomingdales before my tenth reunion and it was horribly uncomfortable! Maybe I'd invest in SKims?",

            "body": "MY TIME TO SHINE! Hello, I am a cosmetic chemist. I work alongside a much older formulator than myself, he developed many many many patents in skincare, hair care, etc. One specific line he worked on was Olay. Olay is one of the only, if not the only, skincare brand that has real clinical results on their packaging that are 100% honest. Olay is in the same price range as Loreal, so this would be another great line to look into. So here's the cosmetic chemist mumbo jumbo. It's all the same, my friend. Okay maybe this skin cream has a fancy extract in it that \"helps\", or this one is vegan, yada yada yada. Moisturizers are generally all the same: put some glycerin, some CCT, some emollients, water, a preservative, and there you have it... a moisturizer. The best benefit would be to choose one with sunscreen if you are not already using a sunscreen. Different ethnicities start aging at different times, for example, I'm Caucasian and biologically start showing signs of aging at a whopping 16 years old, RIP to my skin. \n\nYour best benefits will be to moisturize, use a sunscreen, use an eye cream (a preventative will be the best), and always clean your face. There's of course wrinkle repair and all of that. But until you are to the point of needing that, what I have listed will be your best preventatives for early aging.",

Like pink hair would be awesome but realistically it wouldn\u2019t match my style or make up that I wear every day. People who wear Lisa Frank stickers and hello kitty kawaii band aids all over their face or super dramatic eyeliner and sparkly eyeshadow are awesome and I always draw inspiration from those looks but for me I need to stick to make up that can mesh well between styles and I can realistically wear in public or to school. The people I draw inspiration from are awesome but they do make up either as a career, hire someone to do make up, or go to events where that make up will last looking good and fit the event. \n\nTLDR: Id love to do make up like I\u2019m in Euphoria but I\u2019m not in euphoria and I\u2019m lazy, and that\u2019s okay",

I\u2019ve heard it many many times and I too get frustrated sometimes.\n\nWhat type of hairstyle are you looking for? You said your hair is straight? Have you checked out the instyler tool? \n\nFor skincare definitely make sure to use a proper cleanser not just a body wash. Remember to moisturize and if your concern is the occasional pimple then I\u2019d recommend a spot treatment.\nMy favorite regimen to follow was banish skincare. Check them out for sure, their spot treatment, pumpkin mask &amp; clay mask worked amazing for me. Omg I almost forgot their vitamin c must was amazing too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nMakeup is such a broad topic...you can always head to a Mac or sephora to get a foundation match. \nBrows have changed over the years so filling them in is a a must for me who has over tweezed in the past.\nThis response was pretty long but I tried to get straight to the point lol, I hope it helped and I\u2019m definitely here still if you want more advice/help with makeup \ud83d\ude0a",

It makes me feel SO much better and is so worth the price to me.\n\nI sometimes drop into the benefit brow bar at ulta if my home waxing for my brows gets a little out of shape... then i'll  grow mine out and go in. so that's probably maybe 3 or 4 times a year max.

Here are a few points on how to choose your toothpaste for pimple treatment:   \n\n\n1.  White Toothpaste.\n2. Avoid teeth-whitening toothpaste.\n3. No Gel or Fluoride kinds of toothpaste\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsage:\n\n1. wash your face\n2. Apply only on the pimple, not on surrounding skin.\n3. Keep it for 2 hours or overnight. \n4. wash it gently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToothpaste cannot be treated as a medicine, but it surely reduces the pimple size. It may cause irritation and inflammation, hence do not use it more than 4 times a week.\u00a0After applying toothpaste on pimple once a day, for 2-3 days in a row, you might notice an improvement in the size and color of the pimple. After which it is advisable to allow the pimple to heal on its own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.\n\nJahnavi",

            "body": "Hello.   \n\n\nAcne takes time to go. You are doing great. **Try some benzoyl peroxide** \u2013\u00a0Like salicylic acid**,** Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that contribute to acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions, and it\u2019s less irritating to the skin to boot. Benzoyl peroxide also helps peel away layers of dead skin, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated, including clear skin in its place.  \n\n\nHere are some of the general tips to help you with your acne. I hope it helps!  \n\n\n1. **Don\u2019t touch your pimple.**  \nMost people who have acne, have the habit to pop it. It is a big NO. Never pop your pimple, they have bacterias in them, bursting them will only spread them and infect other areas. Don\u2019t touch your face because it contains dirt and oil so constantly rubbing or touching your face and the affected area will cause inflammation, redness, and pain.\n2. **Keep it simple.**  \nTry to avoid makeup, applying foundation and powder on the affected area will make the acne worse. Oily products will clog the skin pores and worse the situation. Wash your face before sleeping, don\u2019t rub or use harsh soap again your skin, keep it simple, this also removes excessive oil. This will help remove dead skin cells, dust, and impurities and give\u00a0a clear skin.\n3. **Drink more water.**  \nKeep yourself hydrated by drinking 9-12 glasses of water in a day. Skin like other organs of the body like kidney also needs enough water for hydration.

            "body": "Hello! Hairstylist here! \n\nThe natural hair spectrum ranges from level one (black) to level ten (very light blonde). In your picture it looks to be about a level 4ish. When colouring the hair if you\u2019re looking to deposit colour and depending on whether you\u2019re going lighter or darker that will determine whether there is lifting involved. (\u201cLifting\u201d referring to lifting the \u201clevel\u201d of the hair from one level to another. AKA lightening). Because your natural hair colour is black any colour you dye your hair, aside from black, will always involve some kind of lightening aspect to it. Ultimately, the amount of lift depends on how light you wish to go. From level one to level four, you\u2019re looking at 3 levels of lift, which can be achieved through use of colour and 9% peroxide rather then through use of bleach.  However, you could also use bleach with a lower volume of peroxide. It\u2019s a grey area, the route and method and best course of action would be determined by your stylist after a consultation. \n\nWhen used correctly by an educated stylist bleach and lightening is not as scary as the reputation it has. Modern day colouring technology allows us to use the most gentle and effective formulas then ever before! Bleach gets a bad rap because of bleach fails by people who have no idea what they\u2019re doing lol. \n\nIt\u2019s great you\u2019re planning on going to a stylist! There\u2019s a lot to consider when looking at a clients hair and determining the best course of action. Like I said, bleach gets a bad rap. Don\u2019t be afraid of lightening, it\u2019s really not that scary in the hands of a trusted professional :-). \n\nHope this helps!",

Higher heat settings are better for resistant hair, but be careful. Once you've dropped the new curl, twist it around your finger and hold the strand until it's cooled. You can speed up the cooling using a blowdyer on a cold setting if you wish. Once the curl is cooled, let it fall and apply your hairspray (make sure the spray is STRONG hold!) By individually spraying each curl once it's finished cooling, you will ensure a better hold throughout the day. When you heat up hair, you are changing the bonds within the hairstrand and they remain easily changeable while they remain heated, so by letting them cool in a tight curl unaffected by gravity they will definitely have more longevity. You can then give your finished head of curls another coat of hairspray to keep the final style in place.",

            "body": "Hello!\n\nSplit and dry ends could be from past heat/chemical damage. You can make the appearance of the ends better with a mask but the only way to really combat the look of them is to chop them off. \n\nWith that, you can start a new regimen for your hair. Your scalp is overcompensating for the lack of moisture in your hair, so to combat this I would recommend investing in a sulfate free, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I would also say if you dye your hair or use heat on it, invest in a hair mask and a good heat protectant!\n\nMy favorite heat protectant: Briogeo Rosarco blow dry perfection &amp; heat protectant cr\u00e8me.\n\nGood luck!",

I\u2019ll also recommend some of YSL\u2019s lips some are very sheer that I consider them lip balms!!\n\nI would even say, invest in a lip tint and put a gloss/lip balm on top to make the color stay and also give that natural look!\n\nGood luck!",

            "body": "Hello!\n\nI also suffer from extremely dry and sensitive skin! I would recommend to go through your products and see what can be thrown out! Skincare all starts with the makeup remover you use! I recommend using micellar water, it\u2019s gentle and usually doesn\u2019t have a lot of ingredients!  Try to use a very gentle cleanser such as Cetaphil! To get a deeper clean use a soft facial brush but make sure to sanitize after every use! Then and this is important: invest in a good sunblock and moisturizer!\n\nI personally recommend these moisturizers:\n\nAny moisturizer from Caudalie. (French brand)\n\nDrunk Elephant (literally their moisturizers are so good!)\n\nMy personal favorite and what I\u2019m currently using: Belief aqua bomb moisturizer\n\nI will admit, the moisturizers are pricey but well worth it! Step into Sephora and get samples, best way to see if you\u2019ll react! Good luck! ",

I do use a mattifying moisturizer with added spf so that I can multitask with as little product as possible. Then I go in with a pore filling primer (I use the tarte timeless primer but I have also liked benefit porefessional, I am also trying out the elf putty primer\u2014 no verdict on that one yet). Then, I prefer to use a lower coverage foundation or even a tinted moisturizer because you can\u2019t really tell as much when it starts to slide off your face. In the summer, I\u2019ve been known to use the benefit hello foundation and in the winter I usually go for the bare minerals complexion rescue tinted moisturizer. Similarly to you, I then use some concealer under my eyes and bring the excess to my nose, forehead and chin. I immediately set it all with a TON of banana powder. I use essence brighten up banana powder and I find it works wonders for my t zone if I bake with it \u2014 NOT if I just apply it with a powder brush. While that bakes, I put on my brows and other powder makeup (bronzer, blush, highlight and eye shadow). I will brush away excess bake and kind of push any left over powder over my face to blend everything together. I find the most important part of my routine and the part that keeps me from getting super shiny and also keeps my foundation in place is setting spray. I have been going back and forth between fix+ and TF hangover setting spray. \n\n*TL;DR Setting spray is EVERYTHING. Good luck!",

I wanna start off by saying please don\u2019t use the apricot scrub mentioned above, in aesthetics class that was our prime example of an item used that is bad for you. We studied the ingredients and the affect each has on your skin. Start with more water intake, as this will not only help your body but it will also help your skin! \n\nLook up massage techniques for under the eyes that you can use while washing your face. This will help decrease the dark circles and feel good. \n\nI have my boyfriend using First Aid Beauty from Sephora because it\u2019s an entry level price and really simple + gentle + nonscented. Use their face wash, then moisturizer once daily. Once a week use an exfoliant (chemical or manual) to help your skin\u2019s cell turnover rate. Your skin will take about 3 months to really (I mean 100%) get used to a skin care line. It may freak out in the beginning but please stick through anything you choose rather than skipping around to other things hoping for better results! ",

You wont ever completely rid yourself of them, but they will fade with time and moisturizers. I make an all natural stretch mark cream that is helping to fade my pregnancy stretch marks.

The best option for fine hair is lightweight products and very little amount when you do use them.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a pretty permanent solution, getting a perm done (and believe me there are a lot more styles that can be done then people think) will add volume and a nice wave or curl to your hair. \n\nI have a friend with very fine and straight hair and we gave her a spiral perm and she absolutely loved it. Now all she needs is curling mousse after a shower and she\u2019s good to go!",

The one piece of advice that I've noticed is not talked about, is going back to your laser appointments every 2 months or 8 weeks. I believe laser places suggest 6 weeks but that amount of time does not give the hair enough time to grow back so that the laser can remove the root of the hair.  Once I started going every 8 weeks to 2 months I noticed a world of a difference. I hope this helps and good Luck :) ",

Drinking a lot of water helps me too. I rarely drink soda, and I drink alcohol in moderation as these tend to make me dehydrated.

Out of nowhere it clears up and I realized the only thing I had done differently was switching toothpastes! I guess I was allergic to some ingredient that I didn\u2019t realize and now I use Hello toothpaste and also a Toms Whole Care so the changes have been good. \n\nI know that\u2019s not a lip thing exactly but my point being, if something is bothering you and it\u2019s chronic, consider everything that comes in contact with your skin every day, not just cosmetics and skincare products, but also dish soap on your utensils, and other things in your environment.

Essentially what you need is shampoo with lots of citrus in, this is super enzymic and help strip more of the oils away! \n\nOptions from Lush:\n\nMontalbano - a solid shampoo bar, lots of citrus in here and super cleansing!\nSeanik - also a solid shampoo bar. lemon to cleanse, seaweed to soften and sea salt for a little bit of volume.\nRehab - a more traditional liquid shampoo. Kiwi and mango to cleanse the hair, with extra virgin olive oil to add some moisture back in. This option is slightly stronger than the other two, so I\u2019d be more careful with coloured hair. If you can get to to a store, ask the staff for a sample.\n\nSide note: all bar one of our shampoos contain SLS, there is nothing in this (as far as I\u2019m aware) that will be making your hair more oily. It is simply used as a foaming agent in our products.",

(The most common one being biotique lip balms and also Himalayan herbals balm. They are both Indian brands! There's mixed reviews! I haven't tried it, but some say it works!) \n\nBut my number one thing would be to put a light, natural, non petroleum/paraben lotion on your lips so that they would be hydrated enough for the skin to just flake off without a scrub or physical exfoliation. Then apply lip balm to seal the moisture.\n\nAvoid physical exfoliation because your lips would dry out and just flake more! Also, it could be out of your control! So please embrace it :)\n\nMy top lip is darker than my bottom one. I just happen to have a lipline that's naturally darker than my bottom and top lip :)) it really doesn't look bad and you'd be surprised that some people admire your lips!\n",
