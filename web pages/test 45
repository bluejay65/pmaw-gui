If I did it for my thirtieth I'd...\n\nHighlights and hair a few days before\n\nSpray tan after months of using my Salux regularly (I get mine from Amazon) and a manual scrub once a week. I got a spray tan in 2003, but they were new and mine was orange! Ugh! Also moisturizing with Bio Oil for scars and it really cuts the dryness and invest in a good body cream. \n\nSkincare! Exfoliation with AHA and my Amour Pacific enzymes. Tons of moisture with German Nivea. Retinol. Argireline. Water (but I drink over a gallon per day anyway), masks...sheet and my Hello Honey! strawberry honey mask for moisture. A week before, a professional facial. I don't think I need acid resurfacing as my skin is actually pretty good for 45. My skin is sensitive, I try not to overdo. \n\nNails! I'd get pink gels. Before I just got a manicure on natural nails, Jewel of India OPI. I'd get them a few days before, not same day! It was Black Friday, too crowded! Anxiety inducing. Pedicure, last time I got my favorite pedicure shade, Pompeii Purple, OPI. Before I'd massage Bio Oil in my hands everyday, a few times a day, I call it my youth serum, lol. \n\nDiet and exercise is definitely most important. I was on Lexapro in 2003, a medication I definitely shouldn't be on. I got a DNA medication test in 18\" and Lexapro came up as incompatible. I gained 30 pounds and first time in my life (i was 29) was over 125. I'd consume less carbs (I'm type one diabetic anyway) and exercise five days a week, weight training and cardio. Yoga for relaxation. \n\nI'd do my makeup myself,  like I did for my wedding. Just lots of trial and error from YouTube tutorials. I did lashes for my reunion, maybe again, but practice more this time? I'm really bad at lashes despite lots of tutorials. \n\nOutfit, really, really good undergarments. I bought a full length Spanx type corset thing from Bloomingdales before my tenth reunion and it was horribly uncomfortable! Maybe I'd invest in SKims?",

            "body": "MY TIME TO SHINE! Hello, I am a cosmetic chemist. I work alongside a much older formulator than myself, he developed many many many patents in skincare, hair care, etc. One specific line he worked on was Olay. Olay is one of the only, if not the only, skincare brand that has real clinical results on their packaging that are 100% honest. Olay is in the same price range as Loreal, so this would be another great line to look into. So here's the cosmetic chemist mumbo jumbo. It's all the same, my friend. Okay maybe this skin cream has a fancy extract in it that \"helps\", or this one is vegan, yada yada yada. Moisturizers are generally all the same: put some glycerin, some CCT, some emollients, water, a preservative, and there you have it... a moisturizer. The best benefit would be to choose one with sunscreen if you are not already using a sunscreen. Different ethnicities start aging at different times, for example, I'm Caucasian and biologically start showing signs of aging at a whopping 16 years old, RIP to my skin. \n\nYour best benefits will be to moisturize, use a sunscreen, use an eye cream (a preventative will be the best), and always clean your face. There's of course wrinkle repair and all of that. But until you are to the point of needing that, what I have listed will be your best preventatives for early aging.",

            "body": "Chanel Volumizer Mascara!! It's a splurge product ($28) but two layers of this and my lashes are like HELLO WE'RE HERE. I got all my family members hooked too, it's amazing.\n\nMy other splurge is Kjaer Weis's lip gloss. The price is annoying ($38) but I love a good lip tint, and the color and consistency are just perfect on every shade. I don't even care about the \"clean beauty\" aspect of it, the way it wears is smooth and buttery. Other gloss tints are too sticky for me.",
