            "body": "Hello, beauiful! As a South Asian gal (Bengali), I love seeing fellow South Asian beauties post on here. Here's some advice I'm amassed over 24 years of being a brown beauty junkie. Hopefully, you find some of it helpful. \n\n**SKIN**\n\nSkin is moody as fuck and you are not to blame for its changes. Your mom is wrong to make those comments, but that's South Asian moms for you. They think they're doing you a favour by tearing you down. Unless your mother is Aishwarya Rai, she's nobody to break your confidence regarding your looks.\n\nI'm a beauty junky but my greatest addiction and area of knowledge is for sure skincare for brown people. Your acne looks like it's most cleared up. I'd try a face wash with tea tree oil such as the [CosRx Low pH Good Morning Cleanser](https://www.amazon.ca/Cosrx-good-morning-cleanser-150ml/dp/B016NRXO06). Tea tree is super irritating on its own and this brand has perfected the formula IMO. Another unbeatable holy grail for fighting acne is [Paula's Choice 2% BHA](https://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-perfecting-2pct-bha-liquid-exfoliant/201.html). This solution sinks deep into skin and actively fights acne-causing particulates. I'd start with those two products and see if you have any luck.\n\n**HAIR**\n\nOf all my traits, my hair is probably what I get the most compliments on. But weirdly enough, I don't take an insane amount of care over it! South Asians are lucky to often be born with dark, shiny hair, and a lot of it. You're clearly gifted in this department too because all of the hair that isn't bleached looks very healthy. I'd pare down your hair routine to nothing outside of shampoo, conditioner, and detangler:\n\n1. **Shampoo:** I use Johnson's Baby Shampoo because I'm broke lol, but it honestly works just fine for me. More important than the shampoo I use is how I use it. I always comb my hair before showering so I'm not ripping out chunks when I shampoo/condition. Then, I shampoo onto my scalp and not the length. Shampooing the length dries it out and make sit frizzy, while shampooing the scalp makes the top of my hair more voluminous when it dries. Also, you want to scrub your scalp gently with your nails or fingertips to lift the dead skincells off and wash all around the root of your hair shafts with the shampoo suds. \n2. **Conditioner:** Again, I cheap out when it comes to conditioner and it hasn't done me terribly wrong just yet. If you're down to splurge, Moroccan Oil conditioner has worked a charm for my hair's silkiness and health in the past. However, again, I find it's technique &gt; product. I never condition the root because this makes my flat hair even flatter. The opposite of my shampoo technique, I only condition the length. Then, I pile my hair on top of my head and clip in place with a claw clip and let the conditioner sit while I finish washing my body, shaving my legs, etc. I wash the conditioner out at the very end. Hot tip for preventing body acne: wash conditioner out in front of you and far from your body instead of letting it wash down your back.\n3. **Detangler:** Detangler adds some shine and reduces the frizz. Frizz is also reduced when you aren't raking through your hair roughly with a comb, and detangler aids with that by making it easier to comb, obviously. I use a super cheap detangler - the[L'Oreal Kids Pear Tangle Tamer](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/loral-paris-loral-kids-delicious-pear-tangle-tamer-265-ml/6000110954070). In fact, I cheap out even further and use the Shoppers Drug Mart drugstore dupe which is a dollar cheaper lol. It smells subtly of pears, makes my hair shiny, and tames frizz. I only use it on the length of my hair like conditioner because adding smoothing products near my scalp makes my hair appear flat.\n\n**LOOK**\n\nYou look so much like my friend, and she is a baddie. So when you say you feel you aren't worth looking in a mirror, it breaks my friggin heart. Because it's just not true. Not at all. But yes, I know what it's like to get bored with your looks.\n\nThankfully, you're gifted with stunning hair that looks quite easy to style. Next time, opt for a layered cut and ask for lots of face-framing layers. However, note that layers means you'll lose some length. So you'll have to make peace with having shorter hair. Just remember, hair grows back! So nothing is a mistake, short of destroying your hair.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to lose too much length, cut it straight as usual but also get some face-framing bangs. During quarantine, I obviously couldn't get my hair cut and I get bored with letting it grow out long and all one size. So I cut the ends straight like your mom gets yours cut, and I cut some angled bangs at the front that start at eye-level at shortest and earlobe-level at longest. Something like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5e/ec/8d/5eec8d3ba19fc57933f2466cfd5f4415.jpg). I'd link the YouTube vid but apparently /r/beauty doesn't allow YouTube links in comments so I'm happy to DM you the tutorial that inspired me.\n\n**BROWS**\n\nTypical brown girl, you've got gorgeous thick dark brows. When you get your brows done, do they thread? And when they do, do they also trim the length with a tiny brow comb + tiny scissors? Trimming the length of brow hairs makes a huge difference in the overall neatness of the brows. Your brow tails look like mine - a little messy. Even if they trim the hair length there, it grows back so fast.\n\nOver numerous COVID lockdowns, I've gotten okay at doing my own brows. Not anything fantastic, but enough to feel pretty when the need arises. I use brow pomade to draw on the shape I want and tweeze all the hairs that fall out of those bounds. Then, I brush my brow hairs upwards and hold in place with a tiny comb, and then use tiny scissors to cut the excess length. GO EASY. You can always cut more, but you can never add more on. Lastly, I take a dermaplaning razor (I got like 100 of the Tinkle razors on Amazon for pretty cheap) and carefully shave down from my forehead to the tops of my brows. This sharpens the edges and contributes to a cleaner overall look.\n\n**OTHER**\n\nLike I said, I'm a brown beauty junky. Clearly\\^. So I'm very happy to discuss with you makeup recommendations and tips and tricks I've picked up over the years that suit our features and skin tone. [Here is me](https://imgur.com/a/vyB0YDs) wearing a FULL face of makeup. Not to toot my own horn but after 24 years on this Earth, I've learned some shit. And I'm so happy to share my findings.",

However, I can't hide that i naturally have arched brows because my brow muscles bulge and create a shadow as shown in the picture.\nI think having small/monolid eyes makes my brows work harder to lift and open my eyes therefore making the bulge look worse. \n\nIm not lifting my brows that much in this attached photo, just regularly smiling. But they bulge so big without trying. I don't know anyone else that has this problem either.\n\nWould botox or fillers work for this? I don't want to lift my brows higher or make my eyes harder to open wide due to botox. Any non costly remedies? \n\nThank you!",

I say go for it- the longer hair does look a bit limp and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a natural reaction for the weight pulling it down. Shorter hair is easier to volumize and with some tousled curls, I think you\u2019d look great! Find plenty of pictures for inspo for your stylist and ask if they have any photos of clients that they\u2019ve given similar cuts to.\n\nHOWEVER if you know your hair gets dried and frizzy, do NOT color it. If for whatever reason the style isn\u2019t for you or you aren\u2019t able to upkeep maintenance, it will relentlessly damage your hair and it\u2019ll be that much harder to grow out. Also always start with something a little longer than what you think you want while being styled. They can always cut more off, but obvs not put it back.",

            "body": "Hello, \n\nFirstly I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way and I went through the exact same thing after trying the inverted filter. However, I have some advice that might change your mind... okay so when you see yourself in the inverted filter it can be shocking as you\u2019re not used to seeing yourself that way and the \u2018flip\u2019 from inverted to not inverted is immediate and stark. However, if you have Snapchat, that camera is not inverted (so that\u2019s how you see yourself in the mirror) whereas the iPhone camera is inverted (so that\u2019s how other people see you). Now, ask yourself have you ever seen an unfiltered, unedited photo of someone you know in real life taken on Snapchat and thought \u2018that doesn\u2019t look like them because they\u2019re features are the other way round\u2019? - no! You probably haven\u2019t even thought that doesn\u2019t look like them or they look so much better in the Snapchat camera because the difference is so tiny in reality. Also when you\u2019re watching these tiktok videos of other people, it may seem shocking to some extent because they may have an off centre nose that it aggressively moving as they switch from inverted to uninverted but the difference really isn\u2019t that noticeable! Try taking a picture of yourself inverted and then not inverted and ask loved ones if they notice a difference or send them a photo with a not inverted camera (so what you see in the mirror) and they\u2019ll say no because there isn\u2019t one. \n\nIn terms of have an asymmetrical face, as the other comments point out, everyone has an asymmetrical face. There are things you can do to create symmetry such as Botox/fillers if it bothers you to that extent :)",

            "body": "Hello, I have bleached hair and I have since I was about 14 years old. I don\u2019t have the same hair type as you, I naturally have a light brown hair colour. I have bleached my own hair multiple times and I have also been to salon multiple times. \n\nI unfortunately have learned the hard way to stay away from bleaching my own hair. Firstly I\u2019ve caused a lot of damage because 9 times out of 10, after bleaching my own hair, I would have to go to the salon to get it fixed, who would have to re bleach it to sort missed spots or bleach bath an ugly toner out:( I now can fairly confidently bleach my own hair due to trial and error I mostly know what I\u2019m doing however I just don\u2019t because it never looks as good as when it\u2019s done at the salon. \n\nAs you have a more difficult hair type to bleach, more so I would recommend going to the salon. If you want a professional result that looks good I would say 100% go to the salon. The other perk of the going to the salon is that if you don\u2019t like it or any problems occur, there is someone who is liable that can fix it. Also bleaching it yourself you have to consider long term damage, of course any lightening products - salon or not - you will cause damage to your hair but the salon will know how to limit the risk. \n\nIf you do decide to bleach your own hair, I\u2019d watch videos as you\u2019ve mentioned, like Brad mondo tends to have good advice, his main points tend to be: \n\n- make sure you\u2019re using the correct % peroxide.\n\n- Section your hair \n\n- make sure the sections of your hair that you want lightening are fully saturated in bleach. \n\n- bleach doesn\u2019t lather. \n\n- use some type of bond repairing treatment such as olaplex after bleaching. \n\n- tone your hair after bleaching so it\u2019s not orange/yellow. \n\n- it may take multiple times of bleaching to get your desired colour. \n\n- your hair will likely need to be a level 9/level 10 to be similar to the picture, may be able to get away with a level 8 and be a slightly darker silver/grey.",
