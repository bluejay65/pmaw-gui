I am middle eastern and trust me when I say I went through this exact same thing your age. \nI know a lot of people are suggesting laser hair removable but I would wait til you\u2019re a bit older to do that. \nWhat really helped me when I was younger was using an Epilator! It\u2019s a little painful in the beginning but so so worth it. If you don\u2019t want to pay to get waxed every month this is a very nice alternative. My hair wouldn\u2019t grow back for a couple of weeks and when it did it would be very thin and soft whereas before it was sharp and dark.\nAs for your facial hair, I would recommend thread or wax! \n\nAlso, as a side of precaution, I would maybe get a blood test to rule out polycystic ovary syndrome. \nLike a few people have said, it could be genetics but wouldn\u2019t hurt to rule out PCOS.",

I\u2019m just asking because I grew up my whole life thinking I was so hairy compared to other women but actually it\u2019s because my hair just showed more due to the contrast from my hair and skin. If that\u2019s not the issue then I would suggest you watch some Alana Arbucci videos. She is very hairy and she talks about what she does to remove it. I just want to say that it gets better. Once you\u2019re a bit older you can do laser hair removal, electrolysis, bleach your arm and body hairs, etc. There are so many options. When I was your age, I used a dermaplaning razor for my upper lip. That helped me a lot.",

            "body": "I think you're right but I'd argue that every brand owner is like that. I mean Rihanna didn't create Fenty out of goodwill to mankind, bottom line is they all want to make money. It's why Rihanna used an SPF in her totally-not-an-add NIGHT routine for her get unready with me video, why Huda wears 80 billion products, why Gurus pack on product after product, following each with discount code etc. \n\nThese people benefit off us spending money we barely have on stuff we don't need. It's not good for your skin, for your appearance (some like a full beat but I certainly don't), your wallet, the environment (hello plastic waste!). It's only good for their mansions, their luxury cars, their private jets to islands.\n\nPretty much all personality-based brands want you to buy buy buy. Huda benefits when her customers buy loads of products, not just one or two. Hence the makeup gets crazier and crazier. Some of these influencers that these brand pages repost are starting to give Trixie Matell a run for her money. \n\nI only follow the brands where I specifically want to keep track of new releases, or I like their aesthetic. For that reason I mostly follow luxury brands with a more classy aesthetic lie Chanel, Dior, Guerlain, Rituel des Filles etc. Even if I can't afford a lot of their products I just like seeing well applied, classic makeup. These brands operate off the motto of \"less products, higher price\", whereas a lot of influencer brands operate off \"more products, medium price\". Similar profit margins but different way of getting there.\n\nI also follow influencers/content creators who've made minimalism, or more classic looks, their thing, like violet\\_fr and Lisa Eldridge. Other than these two, who are admittedly big, I also follow a lot of smaller people who aren't getting sponsorships and commissions yet because it's more authentic. You can just move on when they go down the my-page-is-an-add rabbit hole. \n\nAnyhow thanks for bringing this up because this needs to be discussed. Even if these are good people they are incredibly manipulative and are not out for our best interest. People need to realize that you don't need to buy or wear everything these people have, and often it doesn't even look good once you step away from a ringlight lol",

            "body": "Hello friend! I have depression and sleep problems as a result. My face is certainly not the best - no product can replace what good old-fashioned \"beauty sleep\" can do. However, there are some products, tips, and regimens that have helped me immensely. Hope this helps you too!\n\n* Retinol. Is. The. Best.   \nRetinol promotes skin regeneration, helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles, discoloration, and all sorts of other things. I've noticed a firming effect when I use products containing retinyl palmitate (aka retinol) even in small quantities from cheap brands. But of course, if you can afford better then purchase better. Just remember to use sunscreen every day!! Retinol makes your skin sensitive to sunlight. \n* Collagen supplements are helpful in skin regeneration.  \nPair it with a good vitamin C supplement and/or a multivitamin, and your skin will have the nutrients it needs to be healthy. \n* Use face masks regularly, especially moisturizing ones.   \nCucumber gel masks, aloe masks, and other cooling masks can be especially helpful in alleviating some of the puffiness and hot feelings around those tired eyes. Some days my eyes feel like they're on fire and begging for sleep but I just can't sleep. This helps me feel refreshed.\n* On that note, consider cooling eye drops. It helps with redness and dryness in the eyes, and can make them look more awake. \n* Moisturizers with hyaluronic acid act as a \"filler\", and can reduce the appearance of bags.  \nHyaluronic acid is fantastic under makeup because it plumps up the skin in a nice, natural way. I've noticed that this helps me with the bags under my eyes. It gives a smoother appearance to the skin, locks in moisture, and creates a great base for makeup. \n* Wash your face with the coldest water possible. Not only does it help tighten pores, but it wakes your face up and can bring some circulation back into it.\n* Facial massages increase blood flow to the face. I usually use a face roller after my hyaluronic acid moisturizer to stimulate circulation and make my face feel and look more awake. You can also just massage your face with your hands as you apply your moisturizer so that your fingers glide easily. It's a quick fix to making you look awake. \n\nHope these tips help. Good luck!",

Totally normal. To ease it,Tea Tree Oil, Aloe Vera lotion or a good moisturiser will be a good idea to soothe it as your first time. It eases every time you wax, usually every 4-6 weeks depending on your regrowth rate.\nI've had leg, bikini waxing for years and it's all perfectly normal each time. Sleep on it, don't sunbathe for 24hours as is obviously sensitive, and it's gone the next day.\nThe brilliant thing about waxing is every time you wax, the hair growth becomes less and finer, so it then can be done less often.\nSo much less hassle than shaving stubble, especially on holiday with a blunt rasor!!\nWell done \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf79x",

Also the make of the perfume,ie, the price really does reflect the quality in this situation.\n\nChanel, YSL, Givenchy are the longest lasting due to being well made from Grasse in Provence, France. Personally I use 'Opium' ( Not Black Opium), parfum by YSL, a serious classic perfume with the price tag unfortunately to match (!!!), and literally two drops on your heat spots, behind ear and wrist last ALL day and then into evening when it has 'developed' on your skin, into a beautiful musky night scent. Everyone comments on how lovely it is and alluring!!!\nHope this helps. X",

My hair is dry, frizzy, and wavy, and prone to split ends even though I do not use heat on my hair more than a handful of times a year. \n\nThe most important thing I\u2019ve found for my hair is not getting it wet more often than needed. In order to keep my hair from getting greasy I usually put my hair up in a bun, and then only wash my scalp. \n\nI do still wash the rest of my hair, but only about once a week, or if it somehow gets dirty. I use a gentle shampoo sparingly with lots of conditioner, and then use a leave in conditioner on everything below my scalp, with a focus on my ends. \n\nI also avoid brushing or combing my hair excessively. I also put my hair up in a bun when I\u2019m around the house so I\u2019m less tempted to play with or otherwise damage it. Also, I avoid using those little black hair ties since they tend to pull my hair out. Instead i use thick cloth scrunchies and things of that nature.",
