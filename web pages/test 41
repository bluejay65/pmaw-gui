            "body": "Hello! Hairstylist here! \n\nThe natural hair spectrum ranges from level one (black) to level ten (very light blonde). In your picture it looks to be about a level 4ish. When colouring the hair if you\u2019re looking to deposit colour and depending on whether you\u2019re going lighter or darker that will determine whether there is lifting involved. (\u201cLifting\u201d referring to lifting the \u201clevel\u201d of the hair from one level to another. AKA lightening). Because your natural hair colour is black any colour you dye your hair, aside from black, will always involve some kind of lightening aspect to it. Ultimately, the amount of lift depends on how light you wish to go. From level one to level four, you\u2019re looking at 3 levels of lift, which can be achieved through use of colour and 9% peroxide rather then through use of bleach.  However, you could also use bleach with a lower volume of peroxide. It\u2019s a grey area, the route and method and best course of action would be determined by your stylist after a consultation. \n\nWhen used correctly by an educated stylist bleach and lightening is not as scary as the reputation it has. Modern day colouring technology allows us to use the most gentle and effective formulas then ever before! Bleach gets a bad rap because of bleach fails by people who have no idea what they\u2019re doing lol. \n\nIt\u2019s great you\u2019re planning on going to a stylist! There\u2019s a lot to consider when looking at a clients hair and determining the best course of action. Like I said, bleach gets a bad rap. Don\u2019t be afraid of lightening, it\u2019s really not that scary in the hands of a trusted professional :-). \n\nHope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello, hairdressing student here! \n\nWhen you curl your hair, take very thin sections (not transparently thin - about an 1/4 - 1/8 of an inch). Higher heat settings are better for resistant hair, but be careful. Once you've dropped the new curl, twist it around your finger and hold the strand until it's cooled. You can speed up the cooling using a blowdyer on a cold setting if you wish. Once the curl is cooled, let it fall and apply your hairspray (make sure the spray is STRONG hold!) By individually spraying each curl once it's finished cooling, you will ensure a better hold throughout the day. When you heat up hair, you are changing the bonds within the hairstrand and they remain easily changeable while they remain heated, so by letting them cool in a tight curl unaffected by gravity they will definitely have more longevity. You can then give your finished head of curls another coat of hairspray to keep the final style in place.",
