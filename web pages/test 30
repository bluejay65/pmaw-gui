            "body": "Hello, I have a contrasting idea as I don\u2019t recommend IPL as they won\u2019t really have long term results in shortest amount of time. What I did was to get a package of DIODE LASER for 8 sessions. It has dramatically improved my pits, I can testify. About 80-90% stoppage of hair growth on my 8th session. I availed another 8 sesh package for the remaining 10-20% of hairs which grows/shows-up obviously only after 3-6 months. Today, my last session (9th session) was December last year and I only have around 25 strands or so of visible hair. And they\u2019re not the thick ones like they used to be. \n\nThe diode laser has higher frequency which the derma uses and increases per session. The recommendation was to return every 5 weeks for the next session to occur. And the procedure last around 45 mins. \n\nIt\u2019s a better investment for me with real results. Rather than spending on an IPL DIY which 1. May be expensive 2. May not work 3. May damage your skin further as not all equipments are calibrated/users qualified to do it.\n\nHope you find your best pit solution. Good luck. \ud83d\ude42",

            "body": "Hello, I agree with the other posters - gently exfoliate beforehand (a washcloth/loofah will do it, or one of those gorgeous DIY suggestions someone made. Sugar, salt or fresh coffee grounds mixed with coconut oil or even any body lotion you have lying around is fine), and then every couple of days. I stress please do this gently!!  \n\nYou'll definitely get faster with time :) Take it really slowly for now though, especially around your knees and ankles. I recommend trying one of the razors with a solid lotion attached around the blade. You don't even then really need to use any gel or anything then and it is way harder to cut yourself so you can move more confidently /quickly. But if you want a bit of extra lubrication you just need something cheap - shampoo, conditioner or a light body lotion is ideal.\n\nDefinitely moisturise afterwards, and every day - this will probably have the most impact. Great if you can use a lotion with tea tree oil as that is soothing &amp; antibacterial &amp; will help with any ingrown hairs that may come about. Though if you follow the routine of gentle exfoliation every 2-3 days, and moisturise daily, you should avoid any issues! Good luck!! \n\nI'm an ex beauty therapist and in general I really believe in waxing legs as a) someone else does it for you and b) it lasts longer. But I wouldn't try that til you're a bit older. It hurts at first and can be quite confronting. Just try to be patient...as with everything, practise makes perfect!! You'll get there!",

I\u2019ve found that stuff that has hemp/cannabis seed oil works really really well - for example Peter Thomas Roth Green Releaf Calming Face Oil, Kiehl\u2019s Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil Herbal Concentrate, Herbivore Emerald Hemp Seed Deep Moisture Glow Oil, Josie Maran Skin Dope Argan Oil + 100mg CBD, etc. Those are some of my favorites but I use others as well. I also bring an easy to use calming mask for nights, like Origins Hello Calm (also has cannibis oil in it) but I\u2019ve got others that have calming ingredients in them.\n\nI also really like the It Cosmetics Bye Bye Redness Neutralizing Color Corrector - I found it after Casey Holmes did a video on it bc she also has redness issues.

Been self tanning for about 7 years so I feel I can speak to this.\n\nTips: \n\nShowering: \n I shower every day and I use a gentle soap, Dove Sensitive.  No loofah or scrubbing. The first time you shower after tanning you\u2019ll rinse away the initial base coat and after that every shower it\u2019ll gradually fade.  If you have a good brand it won\u2019t fade much after sweating.\n\nFace:\nI do self tan my face as I like the way my face looks with color on it when I\u2019m not wearing makeup.\n\nMoisturizing:\nkeeping yourself moisturized helps extend the tan.  There\u2019s \u201ctan extending\u201d lotions you can buy but I just use my trusty ol coconut oil.  \n\nThis is my routine: \n\n-exfoliate entire body with OGX Sensitive + Rose Quartz and Pink Salt Body Scrub and exfoliating mitt \n-shave \n-exfoliate again \n-rinse with Dove Sensitive Body Wash\n-gently dry off with towel \n-apply coconut oil with skin that is still somewhat damp/moist from the warm shower \n-apply Bondi Sands Light/Medium self tanning mousse with a self tanning mitt (bought from Amazon) \n-let myself dry a bit\n-apply a second coat of the self tanner \n-let myself dry \n-go to bed in either all black loose clothing I don\u2019t mind getting tan on or just my black satin sheets (hehe \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4a) \n-shower off the next day with Dove Sensitive Body Wash again, paying close attention to the underarm area as I find if you don\u2019t the \u201cDHA Self Tan\u201d scent can linger, not pleasant \n\nI have used quite a few different brands (Jergens, LOreal, St Moriz, Vita Liberata, Fake Bake, St Tropez for many many years, and now Bondi Sands).  BS is my favourite of them all.  Reason being it is cheaper than ST, but equally good quality if not better, as I find it doesn\u2019t fade as weirdly as ST does.  Also St Moriz is quite good and cheaper BUT the smell for me was just awful.  BS the smell isn\u2019t as bad.\n\nAlso, I want to make a point that this routine seems like it\u2019s extensive and yes it is indeed time consuming, however I personally enjoy spending the time and use it as part of my \u201cself care\u201d routine.   I find it relaxing honestly, I usually light some candles and play some relaxing music and just kind of lay out and chill while I\u2019m waiting to dry and take the time before bed to relax.  In order for my tan to be how I like it I do the whole routine weekly.  I touch up the tan about every 3-4 days, and that\u2019s with moisturizing every day as well. \n\nHoped this helped ! Good luck \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

They might also suggest Dermaplaning which is literally shaving off the peach fuzz and first layer of your skin. If they don\u2019t properly assess your skin type you can get keloids off these.",
