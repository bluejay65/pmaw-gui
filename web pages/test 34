            "body": "Hello!! So a tip that I do that really helps me manage my hair in general is this:\n1. Wash your hair at night (I let my hair air dry and to prevent damage from a blow dryer)\n2. Next morning, spray in some dry shampoo (I just use Batisse from Target - the yellow tropical scented one). This will give your hair texture and some grip for the braids. It will also allow you to go 2-3 days between washes because your hair won\u2019t get greasy.\n3. Start braiding (follow YouTube as suggested). I know I should write steps out here but honestly I\u2019m not a word person, but a visual person so I recommend that.\n4. Finish with a light hairspray. \n\nFinally, I just want to say to be easy on yourself. You\u2019re absolutely beautiful and just keep practicing. Have fun with it! \ud83d\ude18",

A few months ago I purchased it for the first time since I know so many people absolutely love it, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try. I must say the formula is great and gives really nice coverage; however, I ran into this issue where the concealer would be squeezed out the top of the part that pushes it down to force it up the tube to the sponge, causing a lot of product to get trapped and become inaccessible (without trying to completely take it apart haha).\n\nIs this a common issue people run into? Or is it just something wrong with the one I have? I wanted to hear from others about this so I can take that into account when considering repurchasing. Thanks! :)",

Kind of panicking here because I can\u2019t tell if I have a cold sore or not. \n\nSunday morning my lips were super dry (as always) so I periodically coated them in Vaseline (as always) only to notice that my upper right lip area had cracked and peeled and was tingly. \n\nWoke up Monday with the first pic - yellow scabby blister thing? Lip area around became red and was tingly all day. I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist told me it is a cold sore and to use Abreva. But the blister fell off and was gone by dinner time? And the lip skin beneath is smooth?\n\nToday (Tuesday) I woke up with nothing, just the tingle tingles and the lip area is still just a bit red and tighter than usual. \n\nIs this a cold sore? I thought they lasted several days? Not 24 hours? Or is it just the cracked lip that has begun to heal?\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: Sorry for my mustache hairs, I self-waxed my upper lip recently and missed quite a few :(",

I spray before I leave the house and I\u2019m good for 12hrs.

My hair is very frizzy and thick, but the perms are what kind of fixed it for me.  \nWhen I have a curly/wavy perm, I always have to let my hair air dry/blow dry it after washing it (like not sleeping on it wet haha), because it will be messy the next day if I don\u2019t.\nMy most recent perm lasted a reallyyyy long time.  I think maybe 2 years?  This might be because of my hair texture though (my sister has pin straight hair and hers lasted a little less than mine).\nAlso, I personally think my perm looks better after about half a year.  I guess more natural looking??\nI hope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello! Fellow \u2018too skinny\u2019 girl here.\n\nI second the person that recommended lowering your sodium intake. Also whatever healthy habits you enjoy, practice them consistently over this coming week. Knowing that you\u2019re putting in the effort to take care of yourself will help you feel and look happier and prettier. For me it\u2019s starting the day with healthy smoothies (nut butters and avocado provide wholesome healthy fats) and doing a couple blogilates videos. For the hair i would recommend a deep condition treatment. Either from the drugstore or with coconut or olive oil. My favorite easy makeup is a light mineral foundation, mascara and tinted lip balm. If you\u2019ll be in the water I feel that ruched/ribbed one-pieces Can suit our body type better than a bikini does. Just something to consider. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far I just want to encourage you to not be so hard on yourself over your body type! I used to feel so crushed when people would comment on my weight, asking if I was bulemic or if I had considered eating more. I even had a friend call me knobbly-kneed like freaking Harry Potter. I don\u2019t know your age but for me as I\u2019ve entered my mid twenties I care less about what others may think of my body type and just appreciate my little body for keeping me going this far lol. Your boyfriend obviously likes you as you are and will just be happy to spend time with you. Hope you have fun!",
