I brush them back and forth with oil using a spoolie, if I do that everyday for a while they will grow. But naturally I do have good growth in my brows so its not a major difference. It did work for me though and I use it in my lashes when they are feeling weak and dense- however this can cause small bumps if you have acne.",

            "body": "Hello, I am aware that there are many negative connotations that are associated with this but have done the research to offer whatever advice I have. \n1) gassiness/baby barfs are due to indigestion; ensure that you eat without your trainer on and use your trainer 1 hour after eating a full meal. \n2) Training too tight will cause repercussions as well as not paying attention to your body while training. I know it is recommended to train up-to 8 hours a day but I find this unnecessary- you can wear a trainer loosely (not super tight but tight enough where its still fitting around your waist snugly) around your waist while working out. Makes that area sweat much more! Do not continue wearing afterwards while it is wet, can cause issues for your bellybutton. \nAlso have an end goal and realize what is feasible for you. It may not be feasible to reach a 24 inch or waist but if you are very set just know it will take long. \nI personally dont train my waist anymore\u2014 was interested in it when I was younger and already achieved the results I wanted.",

I spend every other day doing this while watching tv, depending on growth and how much time I have. It barely takes a few minutes. This helps maintain the shape longer than a few weeks. If you\u2019d like shape them yourself, use a white eyeliner to draw the shape out and tweeze the excess out. I hope this helps!",

(Idk if it will work as well for you, but I have sensitive skin and this worked for me!)\n\n\\- Minimise the amount of products used on my face and clarify them -- I use now mostly The Body Shop stuff, because my sensitive and combination skin really likes it! My routine is: The BS Seaweed cleanser, then a good witch hazel toner, then niacinamide from The Ordinary during the day, and tea tree or brightening serum from The BS at night, followed by The BS seaweed gel face moistueriser\n\n\\- Vitamin A supplements for the week before my period and the week of (as these can apparently only be taken for 2 weeks at a time -- ask your GP)\n\n\\- Really important: Niacinamide after toner and before face moisturizer during the day\n\n\\- Benzoyl peroxide on whiteheads/blackheads/bacne, and tea tree on the big red ones\n\n\\- Used a VERY GENTLE (!!!) exfoliating glove/pad on my face on the second cleanse, as I cleanse twice in the morning -- I did this in circular motions to clear my skin, and it works amazingly!!!\n\n\\- Last but not least, watch 'How I cured my adult acne' by Belinda Masri on Youtube (it won't let me post the link :( ) -- this video changed my life!!! I did everything she said, and it worked brilliantly! I went from a severely stressed-out gal with a crater face to being complimented on how clear it is regularly! I now rarely wear foundation!\n\nGood luck! I hope this stuff helps!!!",

            "body": "Hello! I know this must seem daunting for you but yay how exciting - you get to build an entire wardrobe from scratch! :) My tip would be to first identify your personal style - classic/ bohemian/ sporty etc. I would also suggest checking out Instagram account like minimalist wardrobe - some great visuals on the key basics to give you some ideas. And also do some searches on Pinterest for \"capsule wardrobes\" - I am always amazed by how many different looks can be put together with just a few key pieces. Someone suggested wrap dresses - and I 100% agree! Such an easy flattering style - you can wear with sandals in summer and trainers/ boots and chunky cardigans or sweaters in winter. My suggestions for \"wardrobe staples\" would be: white button down shirt, high waisted jeans, chunky cardigans in fun bright colours that you can wear over plain T-shirt's and also dresses, and accessorise with some fun chunky jewellery. Also a blazer in a bright colour is great to wear with neutrals, and get some fun heeled ankle boots - snakeskin or leopard or just plain back - they go great with jeans but also dresses and skirts :)\nDo reply if you have any more questions :)",

I'd actually suggest going to Lineas, it's a super cheap store and have some great pieces for young women, and you can try clothes on most stores. Another option could be Lefties, cheap as well and usually the employees don't care about what you pick. \nNow on the clothes, a good high waisted Jean never disappoints and flatters curves, you can get them on classic blue denim, a black one is a great choice too.  A loose dress with stockings and high heeled boots it's great for our not so cold weather. For accessories you could go to Forever 21 or Zara, I think these stores are available in most malls. Hope this helps, and you find something you feel comfortable and gorgeous in \u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "Hello! I hope I can offer some useful advice- \n\nfor false eyelashes, it is gonna take some practice. Having a good lash that has a flexible band helps a lot and then making sure the glue is almost dry before applying. Looking down and placing the inner part of the eye first because the outer corner is easier and if the lash isn\u2019t in a comfortable spot in the inner corner, it can cause her eyes to water. Then when the the lash is where she wants it, gentle push her real and false lashes together. I remember when my mom and I were learning to do false lashes that we would apply too much glue and didn\u2019t wait for it to dry and we would end up gluing my eyes shut lol its a funny memory her and I share today.  \n\nFor eye shadow, cream eye shadows are a good place to start because you can draw it where you want it to be and then blend with your fingers. A good bronze cream eye pencil is a good one to have- just make sure to blended right away or the color will set and you won\u2019t be able to blend the edges. When I was getting use to blending, I would practice with my face bronzer so I\u2019d learn where I like to put my crease and how to get a soft blend and using bronzer helped so the colors would not be so harsh and it would blend without any effort since it was a soft powder. For good nude colors, medium browns and golds are the way to go because they look flattering on all eye colors. \n\nnikkietutorials just posted a video on makeup hacks that may be useful to look at if you\u2019re interested- I hope you both have fun! My favorite memories of makeup are always with my mom and I think it\u2019s super special that you two are learning together &lt;3",

I\u2019m currently mostly wearing Chanel Chance Eau Fraiche, but did wear V&amp;R Flowerbomb for more than 10 years since the month it came out pretty much. I think I\u2019m just tired of gourmands right now for some reason? I have and like but don\u2019t use much now, Black Orchid Tom Ford, V&amp;R Flowerbomb and Bonbon. I like perfumes that are both long lasting and moderate-strong sillage. Seem to be craving clean fresh scents for the last 9 months.. price not an issue, niche is great (something like Chloe Sevigny Little flower, I haven\u2019t had a chance to smell it yet but love the idea of having a scent less widely available)(also part of reason V&amp;R Flowerbomb is just not doing it for me anymore). \n\nAlso, perfumes I\u2019ve had in the past but no longer interested in: D&amp;G light blue and Dolce, Versace Bright Crystal, Gucci Envy Me, DKNY be delicious, Ferragamo signorina. \n\nIf you have any suggestions for something, would love to hear it, thank you!!",

My favorite fragrance is Lanc\u00f4me R\u00f4ses Berberanza but I\u2019ve had trouble finding it, maybe it\u2019s been discontinued. I love a rose scent that has musky notes, I particularly enjoyed the pistachio and spice notes of this Lanc\u00f4me fragrance as well. My budget would be in the $200-250 range. I\u2019m looking for options with a strong sillage and longevity, something warm and mesmerizing.
