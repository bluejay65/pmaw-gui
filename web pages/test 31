            "body": "Hello, dentist here who also has bruxism.\n\nHere's the vicious circle. You're stressed, you clench your jaw in your sleep because your brain needs a way out. That's temporal and masseter muscles doing that. Then you keep being stressed. Keep clenching your jaw. The more you clench your jaw, the more these muscles work, and the stronger they become. The stronger they become, the more you clench your jaw, and the stronger they become.\n\nThis needs to be stopped because of two very important reasons:\n1) The clenching erodes your teeth. I've seen people with 1/3rd left of their teeth because of this. It's aesthetically not pleasing, and it's literally your teeth eroding away.\n2) Our jaw joint is a crazy one. The only thing protecting the joint is One Disc in between two bones (mandibular bone and temporal bone) and when you clench your jaw, obviously, you also put a lot of pressure into this disc. Because you're literally pushing your mandibular bone upwards. In time, and this is a relatively short time, you will slowly misplace this disc, and then start eroding it a little. What you will experience first is there will be some pain. Then you will start hearing clicking when you open your mouth or when you chew. Then you will have a lot of pain when you chew. There is more to follow that if you don't get treatment for it. Right now, also because of underlying joint issues, my jaw joint does this thing where it momentarily displaces and then moves back into place. In time, my jaw might stop working completely.\n\nThe first time I was offered a nightguard was roughly six years ago. Different stuff happened and I wasn't able to get proper treatment so I just stopped looking for one, and now I'm here.\n\nWhat botox does is that it disables your muscle cells, so a bunch of your masseter muscle fibers will stop working for a few months. This will lead to these muscle fibers losing strength. Which will lead to less clenching and less damage and after a few appointments, you will have significantly reduced this damage taken.\n\nNow I'm sure it's expensive, because botox is a bit expensive. I don't know what the condition of your muscles are. In some cases, a botox treatment is extremely crucial, because the muscles are already really big and strong. We use botox first, and after a few months we switch to botox and nightguard, in those cases. In some cases, a nightguard is given and then the patient will be followed to see if there is improvement. Your dentist is the one to decide that.\n\nIn addition, what a nightguard does is that it moves your mandibular bone just a bit further away from the joint disc, so when you clench, there's less pressure on it. It also protects your teeth from eroding. So it doesn't stop the clenching, it's just a protective measure. In most cases that's enough. In my case, I clench so bad I break my nightguards.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions, ask away!\n\nEdit: botox on your masseter muscle, if done correctly, won't affect your expressions because it's not a muscle that has any role in facial expressions.",

            "body": "Hello fellow former nail biter!\n\nSo everytime a question like this comes up I race to recommend my holy trail product, not only because it works but also because I was suspicious af before I tried it and almost didn't.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutra-Nail-5-To-7-Day-Growth-with-Calcium-and-Protein-Nail-Treatments-0-45-oz/10451743 \n\n(Sorry for ugly link, I'm on mobile)\n\nI used to get it on Amazon but it's not as consistently stocked anymore. Anyway, you apply it 3 times a day, which I found to be the tipping point where you really see results. It takes about 5-10 minutes to soak in so it's a bit of a commitment, but you can carefully use a computer or phone during. And you need to apply it thickly, I would fully load the brush for each nail and make sure to go over the entire nail including cuticle. \n\nHonestly I have no idea if it has any effect on growth speed, I don't think so? But it noticeably improves nail strength/hardness. I mean we're nail biters, we know exactly how hard our nails are from chomping them, and using this 100% makes them harder.\n\nAnother tip is don't fight with the bottle when it gets low, just set it aside and get another one. When the second one gets low, take the first and pour it into the second. Viola, usable again.",

            "body": "Hello. I was in Mexico when my adult teeth were coming in. When they did come in, my front teeth were stained a very dark yellow. My dentist believed it was the fluoride in the drinking water found in Mexico, the condition is also known as \u201cfluorosis\u201d my case was considered extreme. After years of bullying and crying to my parents about it I had my teeth fixed as a sophomore in high school. I first had to straighten my teeth which took about two years but I didn\u2019t mind because the brackets covered most of the stains. After that my dentist whitened my teeth, or at least tried to. The stains were still very prominent so she ended up having to shave my stained teeth down and then applying bonding on top of them. It was a long costly process but I am very grateful to my parents for it. My life and confidence since then changed dramatically. I know veneers might also be an option but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s even more expensive. Best of luck.",

Causing the tea tree to build up and cause more irritation. Like some have mentioned,  for dry scalp I use Head and Shoulders Deep Conditioning Shampoo and Conditioner. Again I only wash my hair maybe once or twice a week. Make sure to condition only the ends and mid shaft of your hair with a Leave-in conditioner after you shower. It will leave your hair nice and smooth while giving your roots room to breathe. I hope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello, fellow Eastern European :)\n\nAlcohol damages the natural protective barrier of your skin, leaving it more fragile and dehydrated. If it is the primary ingredient of the remedy you have, I\u2019d not recommend using it.\n\nResearch shows that you will get much better results with chemical exfoliation. Products with BHA and AHA can be real game changers. Topical retinoids are harsher but can be even more effective. \n\nYou should look for estheticians or dermatologists that use these principles in their practice. It is a sign that they keep up with the latest trends in dermatology. Asking them about their opinion on sun protection also is a good competence test. If they do not take this issue seriously, it is a red flag. I think that finding a competent specialist is the best scenario because they will know what to do, and you\u2019re likely to see the results quickly.\n\nDepending on the seriousness of your problem and your desire to process new information and take risks, you can learn about this stuff on your own and create your own skincare routine. R/skincareaddiction may be a good starting point.\n\nAlso, stay away from doctors who recommend detox.",

            "body": "As a HEAVILY depressed autistic person, I'm the same! My method is to add one thing at a time. \n\nWhen I wake up every morning I have to pee, so as I'm washing my hands afterwards I force myself to brush my teeth. I found that making it accessible really helped; instead of having my toothbrush in a cabinet, I got something that hangs on my mirror (it grosses me out when my toothbrush is just in the open air because when you flush the toilet, particles go everywhere. This grossout factor was ANOTHER thing preventing me from brushing \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nThen after brushing once in the morning was more of a habit, I started forcing myself to brush before I went to bed. I can't sleep without chapstick because my lips get really dry, so I put my chapstick in the bathroom to lure myself in there, then I guilt myself into brushing.\n\nWhen that felt more routine I worked on showering more often, which is hard for me because while the shower itself is great, I have sensory issues around being OUT of the shower and still being damp. To tackle this I leave a towel for myself in the bathroom so I can't forget it, and I set up a cozy spot away from my bed (wet pillowcase is the WORST) where I can lay my hair out to dry, which keeps it away from my body and makes it a little easier to bear. I reward myself with something really good to enjoy while my hair dries: A favorite snack, 30 minutes of reading a great book, whatever. \n\nThe point is, treat your depression like a wild animal that lives with you and that you have to work around. Leave traps for it. Be prepared for its inevitable victories; forgive yourself for those. Keep in mind that the depression won this battle, but it will lose the war. Know your enemy's method of attack and prepare for it:\n\nCan't get out of bed? Nightstand contains snacks that leave minimal crumbs, sealed in Tupperware to prevent bugs. \nCan't bring yourself to shower? Sanitary wipes for your pits and genitals are a lifesaver. I have baby wipes 'cause I'm real sensitive.\nCan't eat? Snacks like peanuts, dry cereal, chips, etc are key. Tell yourself you only have to eat one. That wasn't so bad. Think you can handle five? What about ten?\nOvereating? Separate your food into portions. Small ones. Force yourself to take only one at a time. When you finish it, see if you can wait five minutes before going to get the next one. Or even one minute, and then you can work your way up.\n\nThe best asset you can have is someone who's willing to check on you. Who's kind to you and allows you to backslide and screw up, but isn't an enabler. If you don't have a person like that, BE THAT PERSON. Schedule little events in your phone. \n\nReminder: Have you showered today? \n\nReminder: It's cool to be full of a billion cells that are all working to keep you alive. All those cells think you're worth something. They don't care about your GPA or the size I'd your paycheck or whatever. They deserve a reward. Drink a small cup of water.\n\nReminder: No matter how much of a piece of shit you think you are, dogs you pass on the street still strain on their leashes to say hello to you because they want to meet you and be your friend SO BADLY, and that's worth something. \n\nReminder: Brush your teeth! One minute per row! That's only ten seconds per section! Brushing your teeth is the only time you clean your skeleton! That's kind of cool!\n\nReminder: Fresh sheets are so incredibly blissful. Wash one pillowcase at a time, I don't care, but try to wash your sheets today! \n\nReminder: Washing your face is annoying, but it's fun to draw little smiley faces in the soap before you rinse. Just a thought :)\n\nWhen no one was there for me, I learned how much I love and appreciate myself. Everyone you know will let you down sometimes, and that's okay! You'll let them down too, and that's also okay! But that means YOU have to be there for you. Even if you feel like it doesn't matter or you're not worth it, thinking of yourself as your best friend who you're kinda mad at or disappointed in but who you still love and want to be happy, is your BEST weapon. Even if you can only do the bare minimum, your best friend is worth any effort you can give, even if it's eating five peanuts and drinking a cup of water. The more tiny things you do, the better you'll feel, and then you can do bigger things, like starting to work out and learning how to do something new and finishing old projects that have been collecting dust for years. Recovery isn't a destination, it's a journey, and every single step counts!",
