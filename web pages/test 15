So here goes my thoughts - puffy eyes need cold patches, cold roll ons, caffeine because they are accumulation of water (and fat, but I'm not 100% sure) under the eyes and this stimulates circulation. Dark circles may be result of dehydrated skin (not dry skin necessarily!!!) so this is very important to watch out for! Supposedly, botox injections also help with the more severe cases - never tried it.",

Men sure seemed to be a lot less surprised to see me in it when they still read me as \"one of them\".\n\nBut god damn it I was so tired of hiding from the mirror and wearing baggy hoodies when makeup look pretty and dress go spinny and feminizing hormones make me look gorgeous. Life is too damn short to hate my body and my clothing at any age let alone my 20s y'know.\n\nNow that working from home is a thing I have two webcams open and visible on a monitor at all times, so that if things get to stressful I can just look at myself from multiple angles and remember how much prettier I am now.\n\nMaybe that makes me a narcissist.

You can try a travel sized trial (all you pay for is shipping) to see if you like it, and go from there.\n\nI\u2019ve changed my topical treatment a few times depending on concerns (at first it was acne of course, now it\u2019s mainly redness/PIH) and it\u2019s convenient and easy with quick response times.\n\nI take birth control now too which has amped up progress, although I know you don\u2019t want to take anything along the lines - just figured I\u2019d mention because curology was not the end all be all for me... it\u2019s still an ongoing process!\n\nFinally, I recommend cosdna.com for anything you try out. It lists ingredients and rates them depending on how irritating it may be for skin. YMMV though,  I\u2019ve had weird reactions to products with little to no harsh ingredients.

As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. \n\nPlease note, I am NOT a professional makeup artist, &amp; I make these to inspire looks for others, &amp; give myself a creative outlet.\n\n......\n\nBoxyCharm - Hello, Charmer! Palette \u270c\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udc41 Look Created: Triangle Cut Crease\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Packaging: each eyeshadow pan size is 1.4g, thin black &amp; white cardboard packaging, magnetic closure, medium rectangle shape, mirror inside, pans are not intended to be removable, shade names are below each shadow\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Country of Origin: Taiwan\n\n......\n\n\u26ab # of Shades in Palette: 12 eyeshadows\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Formulas Included: 3 formulas (5 mattes, 6 shimmers, 1 pressed glitter)\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Designation: neutral warm, w/ a pop of green/blue\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Type of Press: soft-press - lots of kickback in pan, some fallout on my face\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Extra Information: first-ever BoxyCharm-branded eyeshadow palette, cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, 12-month PAO\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Price: $39.00\n\ud83d\udcb2 Price: $3.25/shadow \n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udd0e REVIEW: \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fPatchiness: no patchiness \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fBlendability: everything blended easily together with the slightest effort \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fFallout: slight fallout w/ some shades; the most being from 'Spoiler' \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fShade Variance: there is a nice range of light, midtone, &amp; deep shades. There are also a few neutral transition shades for light/dark skin. \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fFormula: I was really impressed with the formula. The mattes are kind of powdery, but apply pigmented &amp; solid. The shimmers are smooth &amp; rich with color. The glitter actually has a base pigment, so it's nice to use on it's own for a pop of glittery color. There are no 'dud' shades. \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fPackaging: kind of cheap looking &amp; boring, not reminiscent of a $39 product \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fRecommendation: For an in-house brand palette, this is quite nice. I like it a lot. You can do a lot with it, &amp; the formula won't let you down. I personally believe this palette is heavily underrated. With all the beauty in the shimmers, this would be an excellent palette to keep around for 'special' going out/event looks. I like this palette enough to keep it in my collection.\n\n......\n\n+ Favorite Shade: Popup\n- Least Favorite Shade: Full Size\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udea6 Rating: B",

            "body": "I like both starface and paradox beauty. \n\nI love the branding and price of starface for sure, so they will always win. \n\nThey have a carrying case ($15 for 32 stars and a case with a mirror), refills (around $11), nose strips ($6), etc. They also have a few coupons you can get just from winning their pong game on the website (goldstarforyou) or proving you're not a robot (imnotarobot). You may need to actually connect an email to the site for these to register but idk, it's worth a shot.\n\nWith Paradox lucky stars idk what kind of coupons they have, but its $18 for 40 stars (my pack was actually missing a row or 2 but I got mine in a subscription box so who knows). No carrying case or anything, but there are more stars. I also like how these are black so you can see the gunk clearly.\n\nIf anyone knows some larger spots, let me know! The stars are a little small, and I loved the starface hello kitty spots because they were larger.",

If your hair is falling out and you've gained weight maybe you're not eating right, so start to pay attention to your diet. And I don't mean start a fad diet to lose weight, I mean watching you're eating enough nutrients to nourish your body. Working out will help you and boost your confidence so making it an habit could be a great thing. Also watch your water intake and make sure you're sleeping enough as well.\nTo look put together you can try using a tinted moisturizer and curling your lashes, or use some lipgloss. For me, perfume is a mood and confidence booster, even if it's something that doesn't reflect directly on your looks, smelling nice makes me feel great. \nYou're on your twenties, that's peak beauty for me!

If you\u2019re on a budget, The Ordinary is awesome. You can also sign up for an Allure Beauty Box and or the Dermstore sub. They send great products for close to nothing. \n\n2. But if you do have more budget... laser skincare is the bomb, girl. No cream will do for you what a laser can. \n\n3. Symmetry makes a huge difference. If you\u2019re on a budget, learn to fake it using makeup. If you have more money to spend, a reputable med spa can help you put things in place with Botox and fillers. \n\n4. What women aspire for our bodies to look like is totally different than what men are mostly attracted to. We will work our asses off in the gym to attain a perfect size 2 and what do men mostly like? Size 6-8 with curves. (But if you\u2019re naturally a 2 there are men out there who dig you too.) \n\nDo what makes YOU feel beautiful but if you\u2019re worried about being sexy enough, chances are you\u2019re closer to that goal than you think. \n\n5. My husband says I have a hot body (hello, E cup) but you know what I get a crazy amount of attention for? My feet. It\u2019s crazy. I can\u2019t post a cute shoe pic on Instagram without numerous men sliding into my DMs. I had a friend from high school ask if I could send him shoe pics, which I declined. WTH. If you want to be a sex bomb, keep your feet in top condition with a fresh pedi! \n\n6. A clean smile goes a long way as do white sparkly eyes. Get some beauty sleep and eye drops. If your budget allows, filler can hide your dark eye circles. I use concealer around my eyes as a primer and that\u2019s also an option. \n\n7. Waxing is great but a strong word of advice: get it professionally done, on schedule, 3-4 times. You want to get your hair on the same cycle and it will hurt less when you eventually DIY at home. We don\u2019t need another hero. Don\u2019t attempt a bikini wax at home if you\u2019ve never had wax before!",

            "body": "Hello!\n\nFirst off, kudos to you to trying to look better for yourself. No one is \"too ugly\" to put effort into their appearance, and you might find you feel a lot better about yourself once you do start putting effort into your appearance. I know I certainly don't feel good when I don't put into any effort and when I put in more, I definitely feel more confident. \n\nSo first, let's start with what you bring up first: **Body**. Working out is a great way to feel healthier and feel more confident in yourself. However, know that **if you already have body issues, they will not go away with becoming skinnier.** I learned this a while back, but once you are skinnier, you will just find something else to nitpick on your body so be mindful and accepting of yourself as you are. I would also recommend taking a women's multivitamin and drinking the correct amount of water as you suggested. Chloe Ting does have great workouts but they are mainly cardio. You might notice some slight muscle definition and gain but it'll plateau rather quickly.\n\nSecondly, **hormonal birth control can be very difficult to be on**! It's not so simple as starting it and it will magically reducing the one thing you want to reduce (though that would be nice). **It can give you acne, it can make you gain weight, it can make you depressed, and you will probably feel like shit for the first few months you start taking it.** I was personally really lucky with hormonal birth control and the first pill I started on worked just fine for me and had very little side effects, but I know more women who go on it and have pretty adverse side affects than those like me who don't. \n\nI personally manage body hair with a **hair trimmer, eyebrow razers, and shaving**. Waxing takes too much time imo and is rather annoying, but trimming is really easy and cuts the hair really short (albeit the hair will still be there). I trim some parts of my body hair (usually just my arms and I use the **ManScaped Lawn Mower 3.0**), shave my armpits and legs, and then use the eyebrow razers (these guys: [https://www.amazon.com/Tinkle-Eyebrow-Razor-Pack-6/dp/B014HNOXZS/ref=sr\\_1\\_7?crid=3GOJWRCAJNKY8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=eyebrow+razor&amp;qid=1611284937&amp;sprefix=eyebrow+raz%2Caps%2C309&amp;sr=8-7](https://www.amazon.com/Tinkle-Eyebrow-Razor-Pack-6/dp/B014HNOXZS/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3GOJWRCAJNKY8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=eyebrow+razor&amp;qid=1611284937&amp;sprefix=eyebrow+raz%2Caps%2C309&amp;sr=8-7)) to take the peach fuzz off my face. I also use the eyebrow razers to manage my brows a bit (usually only use them to take hairs off the top of them). I have never ever had an issue with these razer making my facial hair appear darker or thicker - it just comes back as peach fuzz every time.\n\nMoisturizing your body makes a HUGE difference in the texture and softness of your body's skin. I used to never do it and then randomly decided to and hoo boy there is such a difference. My recommendation is just find a thinner moisturizer with a pump (I like Jergen's, you can find them at any Walmart). I always moisturize before bed. I also use a Wet-Skin moisturizer after the shower (basically just a lotion you put on while still wet in the shower). I also use the Jergen's wet-skin moisturizer, really love it.\n\nOkay, now **let's move onto skin**. Skincare can kinda be trial and error, ngl. I've used so many products over the years. **What really helped me improve my skin quickly was Curology** ([https://curology.com/](https://curology.com/)). They do custom skincare treatments (basically just a cream you put on at home at night before moisturizer) and they really work. \n\nThe **basics of a skincare routine is cleanse, moisturize, and then protect** (AKA apply SPF in the morning). This is as basic as it gets. If you feel like you want or need more, then you can add more but it's not necessary. Find out what your skin type is and try out some products. If you're interested in Curology, do that first before buying other products because the dermatologists at Curology ask you to use products without other actives (actives are ingredients such as vitamin C, retinol, AHAs, BHAs, PHAs, etc.) in them.\n\nSPF is really important because sun exposure is the #1 cause of skin aging. Applying SPF daily (even on rainy, cloudy, snowy, non-sunny days) will help with your acne scars as well, as those often darken due to sun exposure. Your forehead being darker might be something you can fix, but it also might not be. Some people's skin just have different levels of pigmentation on different areas of their bodies and that's pretty normal if you have darker skin.\n\nAnd then **fashion,** this is really hard to give advice on ngl. Buy thing you like but you know you will actually wear. **Do not fall into that trap mentality you seem to have now, where once you look XYZ that you will be happier or love yourself more.** As I mentioned earlier, if you have body issues, they don't go away once you look a certain way. They will still be there, but maybe manifest in a different way than previous. Again, try to love and accept your body no matter the way it looks. Focus on what makes you feel good and healthy, and not how much you weigh or how your body looks.",

            "body": "Hello! First of all, congratulations for making the decision to be better and look better, and good luck on your journey!\nI'm a 24 year old female and I've had what you might call a glow up throughout my late teens and these early twenties. It has been a long journey but I've learned a lot. \nI can tell you that the first thing to learn about is self love, and whatever that might mean to you. For me it's been really important to me to acknowledge that I'm worthy of respect and love regardless of how I look like on the outside. \nWork on the inside will reflect on the outside. \nThe less I worried about losing weight the easier I lost it, because I focused more on how I felt and how to nourish and honour my body rather than in how it looked. \n\nNow, on to the more concrete advice, drinking enough water and a healthy diet will improve so much your skin, hair, and body overall. \nDoing the Chloe Thing challenges may or may not work for you, find a workout that you enjoy and it'll become an habit, don't do it just because it's popular.\nDon't focus too much on the befores and afters. The most important thing is that you'll become healthier and happier.\n\nSomething I do everyday is make a Gratitude list, helps me appreciate what I already have and who I'm already am.  I workout about 10 hours a week, but I don't worry too much if I miss a day or something, I try to eat healthy most of the time but I don't track calories and I've stopped restricting myself.   I also read a lot and listen to guided meditations  to nourish my mind along with my body. Someday I wear makeup and dress nicely and some days I don't even shower and just wear yoga pants and a hoodie, but on both of those days I feel happy and gorgeous. \nPlaying with my cat always brings me joy, cuddling with my SO brings me peace, teaching my students makes me feel productive, talking to my brother makes me feel grateful. It's all about the little things. \n\nYou do you, try to be your best self. Do it for you and just you.",
