Yes, it definitely was expensive but I found it at Macy's for 20% off which made me feel slightly better about spending so much. I have long hair (past my boobs) and naturally very wavy and I have found it to really make blowing out my hair so easy and fast. I have gone 3 days without washing my hair with how nice my hair looks after blowing it out. I have not noticed a significant increase in hair fall out or split ends. I have been more diligent about conditioning treatments once a week since I started using it. I would recommend but if you can find it for a sale price or maybe a points multiplier I think it would be worth a wait.",

            "body": "Hello! Congratulations on your new role! I recently switched companies which resulted in me needing a professional wardrobe update myself. I had two weeks off between my jobs and decided to do things I've never tried before. I decided to try a personal stylist at Nordstrom its a free service where you consult with a personal shopper and they pick looks for you to try on. This really helped me to build a foundation where I can use pieces I already have with some new items. They have the service at lots of stores which may be helpful. \n\nI also got a facial and I loved the results so much its been a month and my skin is still much more glowy and brighter than before. I would definitely recommend this for treating yourself! You deserve it! I decided I want to incorporate the facial into a routine once every three months so to offset the price I will continue to do my manicure myself. One thing that helps an at home mani look more professional is using an oil on the cuticles and shaping the nails well. I love using mini nail polishes because you have an opportunity to have more colors that you normally would buying full sized ones. \n\nAs far as beauty I think it's worth it to splurge on some  essentials. Even a great shampoo or hair treatment  (Amika Soulfood hair mask!) can work wonders. Sephora sometimes has sets of mascara or other products where you get 4 or 5 trial sizes and a voucher for a full sized item that way you can test before committing. Blow dryer brushes can make styling your hair easier. \n\nLastly, imposter syndrome is real but you've got this!",

I\u2019m nearly 27, struggled with hormonal acne for 10+ years, and just added this to my skincare routine; Patting/spraying extremely salty saltwater on my face after washing daily has completely prevented all deep cystic hormonal acne from forming on my jaw and chin. I still have other skin issues like blackheads and such but this has changed my skin so much!! Someone on this sub (or maybe r/SkincareAddiction\u2026) recommended it for hormonal acne and since starting this 3 months ago I haven\u2019t had a single huge deep acne spot! 1 tablespoon fine grind Himalayan Pink Salt + 1 cup filtered water. I use boiling water, then let it cool. This 1 cup lasts me about 2 months in a spray bottle. I hope you give this a try and it works for you!",

He came to our gym (martial arts) at 15 - shy, slightly over weight, really self-conscious, never wanted to talk or be in the spot light, never made eye contact.  His dad told us that he was having issues with confidence in general, was bullied because of his weight etc.  You could totally tell by the way he carried himself, too.   He was a big kid at 15 (tall)  but sort of walked like he was turning into himself to make it seem like he was smaller than he actually was.  He's a nice kid so I made it my mission to make him laugh or say something other than 'hello'.  It wasn't easy and it took me about 3 months for him to even crack a smile at some corny joke I made.  Over time and through regular training, we saw him improve, get stronger.  I saw him transform from that shy kid who wanted to blend into the background come out of his shell; he stood taller, spoke more than just hello and eventually, started to make his own jokes with the adults.  Eventually, he felt good enough and confident enough in his abilities to compete in the sport so he registered for the tournaments and placed silver and then gold.  Now at 18, he's a totally different person, is a kind, gentle, confident young man and is one of my favourite people to train/spar with.\n\nI'm telling you this because any type of focused training teaches you that you are more than how you look; that your body and mind are strong and that in turn, melts the insecurities away because through training, you repeatedly prove to yourself of how strong and capable you are.",

I'm not a doctor, and I can't stress how much I am not a doctor, but this is very common with people who have ADHD, or autism, or depression, or anxiety, or a myriad of other things. Maybe you have none of them, or maybe you do, either way is absolutely fine. But if you think you might have an executive functioning disorder, there are some resources for how to manage it:\n https://manhattanpsychologygroup.com/executive-functioning-problems-adults/\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you, so don't feel like you're a failure for not looking glamorous all the time. I do happen to have some mild executive functioning issues, so I don't shower everyday, or brush my hair everyday, but I do make sure I look nice and I follow a visual schedule in the morning that literally tells me, okay, go pee, brush teeth, put on sunscreen and lotion, get dressed, feed the dog, etc.\n\nI hope this helps and I hope you don't feel bad about asking or for how you function in the world. It's a hard place to be thrust in to, and we're all just doing our best.",

The comments are right\u2014the people you see on TV have an entire team of people designed to make them look that way. The best thing to do right now is to be gentle to yourself and start small. I myself struggle with basic self-care duties when I am in a terrible episode of depression. Sometimes I don't feel like showering at all, feels like a chore but I always do feel better after whenever I decide to do it. Just a spritz of your favorite perfume and that's it. For your hair you can search \"curly girl method\" on youtube and on reddit, it will teach you exactly what you need to know, I think curly hair is incredibly beautiful, and CGM can help enhance your curl's beauty. You can also try to build a very basic, 5-10 minute makeup routine that enhances your features \u2764\ufe0f\n\nDon't get overwhelmed, you will get there.",

The skin around eyebrows (especially underneath and the sides) are delicate and if not stretched properly can get caught in the thread. The next time maybe you could tell her to be gentler - these days I just tell them to refrain from touching my eyebrow tails, I often bleed there and I do not appreciate scarring.",

            "body": "So I have a Winners aka TJX store aka TJMaxx depending where you're from. I go into their natural section and try new smaller (usually made in my country) brands. \n\nThe current one I am in love with is Botanical Wonder Lavender and Rose Oil Suger Scrub, it leaves my body feeling super smooth and refreshed. It helps get rid of the bumps underneath my thighs and on my arms. I always use it before I shave, it takes off all the dead skin and thins the hair a bit for a better shave. \n\nIve always had acne prone skin, if tried a lot of brands to help my skin out and Dermalogica was the one brand that didn't make my skin feel oily/dry/gross/unclean. Their moisturizer makes my skin super soft and as actually moisturizes! I also began using their face scrub with just cleans my fave so well and since using the products my face has cleared up a lot and during my periods my acne is a lot better that what it would be. \n\nI swear by bath salts! So all consist of Epsom salts which when dissolved break down into magnesium and sulfate this means it can get into your body and help relax muscles and loosen stiff joints (my give my body a little extra rub to help). You can get many different ones, once again I hit up the natural section and get the best bang for your buck (price for size when finding something new) which is Hello Botanical. They have many different combinations that include lavender, sage, orange, coconut, rose... The list goes on. Each main ingredient (like ones listed) have different aromas and reasons for the combo which says on the bag. I usually get anything with lavender because I love it, currently i have lavender and sage which is very relaxing and tranquil, beautiful for an evening.\n\nSo when I used Bio-Oil it was more for after the shower (about every 2 maybe 3 days), moist my body up and header out or to sleep. I saw results after the first 2 weeks of using it. Now depending how apparent the stretch marks/scars are it will dial down the visibility of them. For scars (mine are mainly shaving scars on my legs lol) it will (for me at least) get rid of them. For my stretch marks, they are definitely still their but mine used to be dark but now they are lighter and less harsh, it smoothed my skin while evening out my skin tone.",

            "body": "Looking \"expensive\" has to do with grooming than anything. The nails and nail beds should always be kept neat and clean. Teeth should always be brushed and plaque tartar-free. \n\nI've noticed a lot of people don't really understand what old money really looks like. Allow me to provide some insight since I now have access to that world (I didn't previously). They literally do not care what you look like. I've been at the country club and men and women are running around with bad breath, terrible hair, etc. They ALL know the other is rich (otherwise they don't have access to the cc), there's no need to keep up appearances. A lot of the women just age and do so happily. There's not always a need for plastic surgery or intense makeup unless it's a DIRECT reflection of how the woman wants to present herself. I only find that \"working women\" with careers like myself tend to emphasize physical appearance and skincare. \n\nOne of the most successful Chinese women I know (shops CASUALLY at Harry Winston, Cartier, etc) and is in her 60s. She always just wears a little graphic tee and leggings and slippers because she's comfortable in it. Her whole outfit probably costs less than $70 overall. She only does her brow makeup and leaves the rest of her face bare. Her hair is thin and thrown into a ponytail/bun. But she always looks clean, moisturized, and healthy. The only giveaway TO ME that she's rich? I went to her house and she let me play with her jewelry and perfume. I would have never known. She drives a Prius or just Ubers when she's not in the mood to drive. \n\nWe only met because she came into my place of work to buy something. (Our clientele is NOT rich people). No one spoke Chinese but me and I came out to do basic translation for her. We spent a half hour touring the store, getting to know each other. We gossiped, chatted, I got her water. I spent about 4 months cultivating this relationship with her. When she'd come in,   \nI'd say hello and always go out of my way to help her. Eventually, she asks if I wanted to come to her house sometime to try her cooking. \n\nBe careful about how you judge others and yourself for not looking \"expensive\". Odds are, the real ones don't care and neither should you (to an extent).",

            "body": "Hello! Just a few ideas for you:\n\n- For just 2 eyeshadows you can get a really nice look. Get a shimmery light shade that's just a bit lighter than your skin colour and pat it all over your eyelid with a flat eyeshadow brush. Then take a darker matte colour and add it to the outer corner of your eye with a fluffy blending brush. Start on the outside and blend it inwards to add a nice contour to your eye.\n- if you want to make your eyes look larger, use a white eyeliner pencil or highlighter on the inner corner of your eye, and the pencil on your lower waterline.\n- add a bit of mascara and eyeliner if you want, it's a pretty neutral look so any bold lip will look good!\n- if you want to make Hazel eyes pop, add a little bit of gold eyeshadow under your eye or instead of the lid colour, it really brings out the tones in your eye colour!\n\nI really hope this is useful to you!\n\nxx",

Something that I would do to help advance my skills a bit is mimicking the techniques used in a lot of beauty videos and searching up advice (such as what lip color better suits my skin tone). I feel like the more research that you do, and the more practice that you have with products the better you'll become. With that said, try buying a specific product, or see how other people use the products you already have. For example, maybe you have a colourpop lippie stick, see what other people say by looking it up, looking at photos that are in the description, etc.! Good luck! :)",

            "body": "Hello!! I\u2019m not the most fashionable person, but I can give you some skin care advice. My first tip would be too avoid \u201cnatural remedies\u201d like the plague. Anything like rubbing lemon juice or baking soda on your face is a big mistake. I did this at your age, and it created many more problems than it cured. \n\nI don\u2019t know how severe your acne is, but going to a drugstore and getting a Cetaphil facewash, a Neutrogena moisturizer, Neutrogena spot treatment, and a sunscreen (any brand is fine, just look for a label that says \u201cnon comedogenic\u201d which means it doesn\u2019t clog pores. Neutrogena makes a lot of great ones!) is a great start. If your acne is on the more severe side, like 10- 20 plus zits at the same time, you may want to ask your parent if they can take you to a dermatologist. Oftentimes dermatologists can prescribe a cream or gel that is much more effective at treating acne than an drugstore cream. \n\nIf your parent can\u2019t or won\u2019t take you to a derm, then your best bet is a drugstore cream called \u201cDifferin\u201d. It is a little more expensive, I want to say 20 dollars a tube? But it last for months and you only need a very small amount at night. If you choose to start using differin, you MUST wear sunscreen during the day. Differin is awesome at clearing up acne, but it does make your skin more sensitive to the sun. So thats kind of the trade off there! \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned the skincare addiction sub is great, but I think the amount of info there can be a bit overwhelming for a newbie. But if you have more specific questions thats a great place to go. \n\nLastly, I just want to say, don\u2019t stress to much about acne or beauty. Everyone else will be in the same boat as you worrying about that kind of stuff. High school is a stressful time in everyone\u2019s life, but you should enjoy the ride and try your best to take care of yourself too! I wish you the very best of luck :)",

From what I gather, use a LOT of gel to create a cast over your wet curl pattern so it keeps a hold when dry and doesn\u2019t frizz up. Like I mean a lot, half a palmful for each half. Depending on what type of gel you use though. Also, everyone is different. Some people\u2019s hair likes more moisture vs more protein depending on porosity but also just genetics.",

In the evening ensure to cleanse your skin well to remove the sunscreen, you might want to try double cleanse (either using the same cleanser twice or using an oil cleanser/micellar water to remove the sunscreen first before going in with your face cleanser). A moisturiser would be good too, but what moisturiser you get would depend on your skin type. Once you've got this down, you can slowly add other stuff such as serums into your routine to target specific skin concerns :)",

            "body": "Hello, I love seeing people make posts like this reaching out on where to start, though I wish they would elaborate more on their goals, skin concerns and most importantly skin types. \n\nIf you have dry skin like myself, I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on exfoliants, BHAs or cleansers. Use gentle cleansers. If you have ache or oily skin you may want to try those things though I personally don\u2019t have much advice to give in this area given I haven\u2019t don\u2019t too much research on it. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to focus on anti aging I\u2019d recommend a retinol. It promotes cell turnover making your skin look younger. To start off I\u2019d use the Differin retinol. You can get it an really any drug store here in the USA. \n\nIf your skin and tolerate that you could work your way up to a prescription retinol products like tretenoin aka retin-A. Your skin my be very dry irritated and break out for the first few months so be aware that its a slow process though after the \u2018purging\u2019 period your skin should be clear and glowing. You must also use moisturizer with retinol products. I would advise sandwiching the retinol in between your moisturizer; so moisturizer, retinol, moisturizer. This will not make the retinol any less effective the moisturizer just acts as a buffer making your skin hydrated giving you better results during the purging period. \n\nAlso if you use a retinol or not, always remember to use sunscreen SPF 30 or higher. Mineral sunscreens are better if you have sensitive skin especially. Also don\u2019t use retinol or vitamin A products especially prescription retinols like tretenoin/Retin-A when pregnant because studies have correlated the use of such products during pregnancy and breast feeding with birth defects. If your pregnant peptides are a good anti aging alternative. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend moisturizer, whether you have dry or oily skin find a moisturizer right for you. \n\nLastly do your research on where to start for skincare for your skin type, look on skincare subreddits and youtube.",

A few years ago I had a friend who had chronic BV and the obgyn said that it could be from using washes in your down there area. She switched to just using a non scented cetaphil body wash and taking probiotics and it completely cleared up down there. The fragrances and products in a lot of feminine washes are actually really bad no matter how much testing they go through, it\u2019s recommended you just use water down there. I use the dr.Bronners baby unscented wash down there and it keeps me very fresh and clean feeling. Also make sure you are wearing breathable underwear like cotton and go commando some nights that way you are allowing your down there area to breath and have a break from being stuck in fabric.",

If not, I propose a new project - find what makes you happy! Some suggestions to start - less less less glow up videos, more talking to people, family, friends, people you meet outside at a coffee shop or library. Do you have a favorite bird or animal species? Where do those live? Do you have a favorite pet to pat? Do you have a favorite park, or tree or place to walk? Do you have a favorite time of day? As an example, on Sundays I get a favorite newspaper delivered and I sit on the couch with my husband who does the crossword, I read the paper and drink coffee in the sunshine. I also like fires, so at night when it is cool I will light a fire. I find a favorite tree in every neighborhood I have lived, and I visit it. I touch the tree and say hello in my thoughts. Most trees are a little different, they have like a personality but it is very subtle and it takes time a quiet to meet them to get to know a tree well enough to see it. Try to find a few new favorites that don't involve screens, and spend time doing those things a little ever day for a few weeks. That is how one can start a glow",

This year has been manic and mental and we need to be kind to ourselves. I am a busy children\u2019s social worker and last year I was managing to get out, exercise somewhat and go on walks but this year I\u2019ve not and I have struggled with the knowledge that I too have gained some weight! For me, I\u2019m sure the reason for this is basically just burn out, increased workload and stress, which sounds very similar to you. Reading your story resonated for sure! Is there any way you could incorporate an evening walk with your husband before dinner? Or perhaps before you have to sit down and carry on with more tasks? I know you said you get up early but could you challenge yourself to do a small amount of exercise before you begin working? \n\nI know it\u2019s really really tough, you\u2019re absolutely preaching to the choir but please be kind to YOU. If you want we could keep each other accountable for getting in some exercise? Let me know. You\u2019re not alone in this one bit.",

            "body": "Hello, beauiful! As a South Asian gal (Bengali), I love seeing fellow South Asian beauties post on here. Here's some advice I'm amassed over 24 years of being a brown beauty junkie. Hopefully, you find some of it helpful. \n\n**SKIN**\n\nSkin is moody as fuck and you are not to blame for its changes. Your mom is wrong to make those comments, but that's South Asian moms for you. They think they're doing you a favour by tearing you down. Unless your mother is Aishwarya Rai, she's nobody to break your confidence regarding your looks.\n\nI'm a beauty junky but my greatest addiction and area of knowledge is for sure skincare for brown people. Your acne looks like it's most cleared up. I'd try a face wash with tea tree oil such as the [CosRx Low pH Good Morning Cleanser](https://www.amazon.ca/Cosrx-good-morning-cleanser-150ml/dp/B016NRXO06). Tea tree is super irritating on its own and this brand has perfected the formula IMO. Another unbeatable holy grail for fighting acne is [Paula's Choice 2% BHA](https://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-perfecting-2pct-bha-liquid-exfoliant/201.html). This solution sinks deep into skin and actively fights acne-causing particulates. I'd start with those two products and see if you have any luck.\n\n**HAIR**\n\nOf all my traits, my hair is probably what I get the most compliments on. But weirdly enough, I don't take an insane amount of care over it! South Asians are lucky to often be born with dark, shiny hair, and a lot of it. You're clearly gifted in this department too because all of the hair that isn't bleached looks very healthy. I'd pare down your hair routine to nothing outside of shampoo, conditioner, and detangler:\n\n1. **Shampoo:** I use Johnson's Baby Shampoo because I'm broke lol, but it honestly works just fine for me. More important than the shampoo I use is how I use it. I always comb my hair before showering so I'm not ripping out chunks when I shampoo/condition. Then, I shampoo onto my scalp and not the length. Shampooing the length dries it out and make sit frizzy, while shampooing the scalp makes the top of my hair more voluminous when it dries. Also, you want to scrub your scalp gently with your nails or fingertips to lift the dead skincells off and wash all around the root of your hair shafts with the shampoo suds. \n2. **Conditioner:** Again, I cheap out when it comes to conditioner and it hasn't done me terribly wrong just yet. If you're down to splurge, Moroccan Oil conditioner has worked a charm for my hair's silkiness and health in the past. However, again, I find it's technique &gt; product. I never condition the root because this makes my flat hair even flatter. The opposite of my shampoo technique, I only condition the length. Then, I pile my hair on top of my head and clip in place with a claw clip and let the conditioner sit while I finish washing my body, shaving my legs, etc. I wash the conditioner out at the very end. Hot tip for preventing body acne: wash conditioner out in front of you and far from your body instead of letting it wash down your back.\n3. **Detangler:** Detangler adds some shine and reduces the frizz. Frizz is also reduced when you aren't raking through your hair roughly with a comb, and detangler aids with that by making it easier to comb, obviously. I use a super cheap detangler - the[L'Oreal Kids Pear Tangle Tamer](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/loral-paris-loral-kids-delicious-pear-tangle-tamer-265-ml/6000110954070). In fact, I cheap out even further and use the Shoppers Drug Mart drugstore dupe which is a dollar cheaper lol. It smells subtly of pears, makes my hair shiny, and tames frizz. I only use it on the length of my hair like conditioner because adding smoothing products near my scalp makes my hair appear flat.\n\n**LOOK**\n\nYou look so much like my friend, and she is a baddie. So when you say you feel you aren't worth looking in a mirror, it breaks my friggin heart. Because it's just not true. Not at all. But yes, I know what it's like to get bored with your looks.\n\nThankfully, you're gifted with stunning hair that looks quite easy to style. Next time, opt for a layered cut and ask for lots of face-framing layers. However, note that layers means you'll lose some length. So you'll have to make peace with having shorter hair. Just remember, hair grows back! So nothing is a mistake, short of destroying your hair.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to lose too much length, cut it straight as usual but also get some face-framing bangs. During quarantine, I obviously couldn't get my hair cut and I get bored with letting it grow out long and all one size. So I cut the ends straight like your mom gets yours cut, and I cut some angled bangs at the front that start at eye-level at shortest and earlobe-level at longest. Something like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/5e/ec/8d/5eec8d3ba19fc57933f2466cfd5f4415.jpg). I'd link the YouTube vid but apparently /r/beauty doesn't allow YouTube links in comments so I'm happy to DM you the tutorial that inspired me.\n\n**BROWS**\n\nTypical brown girl, you've got gorgeous thick dark brows. When you get your brows done, do they thread? And when they do, do they also trim the length with a tiny brow comb + tiny scissors? Trimming the length of brow hairs makes a huge difference in the overall neatness of the brows. Your brow tails look like mine - a little messy. Even if they trim the hair length there, it grows back so fast.\n\nOver numerous COVID lockdowns, I've gotten okay at doing my own brows. Not anything fantastic, but enough to feel pretty when the need arises. I use brow pomade to draw on the shape I want and tweeze all the hairs that fall out of those bounds. Then, I brush my brow hairs upwards and hold in place with a tiny comb, and then use tiny scissors to cut the excess length. GO EASY. You can always cut more, but you can never add more on. Lastly, I take a dermaplaning razor (I got like 100 of the Tinkle razors on Amazon for pretty cheap) and carefully shave down from my forehead to the tops of my brows. This sharpens the edges and contributes to a cleaner overall look.\n\n**OTHER**\n\nLike I said, I'm a brown beauty junky. Clearly\\^. So I'm very happy to discuss with you makeup recommendations and tips and tricks I've picked up over the years that suit our features and skin tone. [Here is me](https://imgur.com/a/vyB0YDs) wearing a FULL face of makeup. Not to toot my own horn but after 24 years on this Earth, I've learned some shit. And I'm so happy to share my findings.",

However, I can't hide that i naturally have arched brows because my brow muscles bulge and create a shadow as shown in the picture.\nI think having small/monolid eyes makes my brows work harder to lift and open my eyes therefore making the bulge look worse. \n\nIm not lifting my brows that much in this attached photo, just regularly smiling. But they bulge so big without trying. I don't know anyone else that has this problem either.\n\nWould botox or fillers work for this? I don't want to lift my brows higher or make my eyes harder to open wide due to botox. Any non costly remedies? \n\nThank you!",

Shorter hair is easier to volumize and with some tousled curls, I think you\u2019d look great! Find plenty of pictures for inspo for your stylist and ask if they have any photos of clients that they\u2019ve given similar cuts to.\n\nHOWEVER if you know your hair gets dried and frizzy, do NOT color it. If for whatever reason the style isn\u2019t for you or you aren\u2019t able to upkeep maintenance, it will relentlessly damage your hair and it\u2019ll be that much harder to grow out. Also always start with something a little longer than what you think you want while being styled. They can always cut more off, but obvs not put it back.",

However, I have some advice that might change your mind... okay so when you see yourself in the inverted filter it can be shocking as you\u2019re not used to seeing yourself that way and the \u2018flip\u2019 from inverted to not inverted is immediate and stark. However, if you have Snapchat, that camera is not inverted (so that\u2019s how you see yourself in the mirror) whereas the iPhone camera is inverted (so that\u2019s how other people see you). Now, ask yourself have you ever seen an unfiltered, unedited photo of someone you know in real life taken on Snapchat and thought \u2018that doesn\u2019t look like them because they\u2019re features are the other way round\u2019? - no! You probably haven\u2019t even thought that doesn\u2019t look like them or they look so much better in the Snapchat camera because the difference is so tiny in reality. Also when you\u2019re watching these tiktok videos of other people, it may seem shocking to some extent because they may have an off centre nose that it aggressively moving as they switch from inverted to uninverted but the difference really isn\u2019t that noticeable! Try taking a picture of yourself inverted and then not inverted and ask loved ones if they notice a difference or send them a photo with a not inverted camera (so what you see in the mirror) and they\u2019ll say no because there isn\u2019t one. \n\nIn terms of have an asymmetrical face, as the other comments point out, everyone has an asymmetrical face. There are things you can do to create symmetry such as Botox/fillers if it bothers you to that extent :)",

            "body": "Hello, I have bleached hair and I have since I was about 14 years old. I don\u2019t have the same hair type as you, I naturally have a light brown hair colour. I have bleached my own hair multiple times and I have also been to salon multiple times. \n\nI unfortunately have learned the hard way to stay away from bleaching my own hair. Firstly I\u2019ve caused a lot of damage because 9 times out of 10, after bleaching my own hair, I would have to go to the salon to get it fixed, who would have to re bleach it to sort missed spots or bleach bath an ugly toner out:( I now can fairly confidently bleach my own hair due to trial and error I mostly know what I\u2019m doing however I just don\u2019t because it never looks as good as when it\u2019s done at the salon. \n\nAs you have a more difficult hair type to bleach, more so I would recommend going to the salon. If you want a professional result that looks good I would say 100% go to the salon. The other perk of the going to the salon is that if you don\u2019t like it or any problems occur, there is someone who is liable that can fix it. Also bleaching it yourself you have to consider long term damage, of course any lightening products - salon or not - you will cause damage to your hair but the salon will know how to limit the risk. \n\nIf you do decide to bleach your own hair, I\u2019d watch videos as you\u2019ve mentioned, like Brad mondo tends to have good advice, his main points tend to be: \n\n- make sure you\u2019re using the correct % peroxide.\n\n- Section your hair \n\n- make sure the sections of your hair that you want lightening are fully saturated in bleach. \n\n- bleach doesn\u2019t lather. \n\n- use some type of bond repairing treatment such as olaplex after bleaching. \n\n- tone your hair after bleaching so it\u2019s not orange/yellow. \n\n- it may take multiple times of bleaching to get your desired colour. \n\n- your hair will likely need to be a level 9/level 10 to be similar to the picture, may be able to get away with a level 8 and be a slightly darker silver/grey.",

Theres a high probability if its continuous and all over this is actually keratosis pilaris (like you might get on your upper arms) which is a dry skin condition irritated by physical exfoliation. I recommend switching to a gentle BHA of SA cleanser as an exfoliator and moisturizing daily. Its exacerbated by friction -- do you notice it looks better when wearing cotton all day/worse when wearing scratchy jeans? I recommend a full coverage cotton brief to protect your skin while you figure out whats going on! If that doesnt work, it can also be treated very effectively with medications like accutane. see a derm!",

            "body": "Hello! For nails, I really love Essie and OPI polishes. Invest in a strengthening base coat (I like OPI\u2019s). I would also recommend moisturizing your hands often.  As far as makeup: I\u2019m a big fan of Urban Decay but if you\u2019re looking for something less pricy, color pop offers some very pigmented products with low costs. Find a shampoo and conditioner that work well with your hair type and don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different washing intervals - some people need to wash more, some need to wash less. Do not cut your own shag, you\u2019ll wind up with a mullet. Other tips: find a mascara you really like. Some days, just using mascara, eyeliner, a little lipgloss, and a pinch of the cheeks really livens up my look. Invest in a good hairbrush (wet brush) and a detangljng spray. I also like running a little argan oil through my hair when it\u2019s damp - especially before I blow it out.",

            "body": "Hello fellow late-to-the-feminine-game lady!\n\n\nNails: Invest in a good quality clear top coat. Even crappy polish can work for you with the right topper. Also grab a decent \"nude\" shade. Something like a beige or soft pink that you could wear to a formal event. Otherwise, grab yourself some brights and rainbows for fun. My holy grail brand is Holo Taco; it's woman owned and specializes in bold, unusual finishes like iridescent flakes and holographic glitters. The brand owner also has a youtube channel, SimplyNailogical, where she has made several videos on how to care for and strengthen your natural nails!\n\n\nHair: Is your hair textured/frizzy? If so, I highly recommend the curlyhair subreddit. There is an FAQ there that walks through all of the hair things, including porosity, hair structure, protein, the difference between hydration and moisture, etc. Even if your natural hair is stick straight (though that's very rare) you can still learn a lot about which oils/butters will best suit your hair needs! Once you have narrowed down what your hair needs help with, you can ask for specific product recommendations!\n\n\nSkin: While you didn't explicitly mention it, a fantastic form of self care (especially if you've never tried it out) is skincare. The skincareaddiction subreddit is a great place to ask for skin specific advice! There is also a youtube channel called Hyram that has a Skincare 101 series. It will walk you through the basic steps of a full routine so that you have some running knowledge!\n\n\nMakeup: The basics that you'll want on hand are a concealer, a mascara, and a neutral/nude lip color. Those three will do a lot of work for you from day one! (Specific product recs will depend on your location and skintone, but this sub is a great place to ask for suggestions!) If you're new to eyeshadow, Colourpop has a wide array of small palettes that fill a color story. I bet you can find one that hits all of your current goals! As for eyeshadow brushes, RealTechniques has some inexpensive brushes in a set to start out with!\n\n\nMy personal favorite product: SheaMoisture has several deep conditioning hair masques that make my hair *so* happy. Especially coming out of America's winter, it has been a lifesaver for keeping my hair soft and untangled!",

Its a few minutes 3 days a week and it make me have endorfines and its free.\nI try to read a lot of books and spend less time in apps like instagram. That shit my brain and contaminate my vision of beauty.\nIf Im on instagram I follow people with different bodys and figh the hegemonic standars . Also I look for people that looks like me, to see their outfits.\nI use my bike and thats a great moment because I think less on my looks.\nSometimes I try to play with make up and watch tutorials for a big eyes.\nI always use lipstik to give my face some color.\nAlways use protection for the sun in my face.\nSometimes I make items of the things that i like of my face or body and try to potention it. Like my hear or boobs.\nI try to walk in a good posture.  This is really important.\nI try to remember that confidence it make people hotter.\nSometimes I look for clothes that fit whit my body or look good with my color of skin.\nSometimes I prove to change my style...like pin up, or romantic style. \nI try to feel comfy and sexy with my underware first.\nIf i cant feel like a diva all the time, its ok...im not a machine.\n\nIm sorry for the long post.

I like being valued for my intelligence. Yes, hello, that's my job. Men sure seemed to be a lot less surprised to see me in it when they still read me as \"one of them\".\n\nBut god damn it I was so tired of hiding from the mirror and wearing baggy hoodies when makeup look pretty and dress go spinny and feminizing hormones make me look gorgeous. Life is too damn short to hate my body and my clothing at any age let alone my 20s y'know.\n\nNow that working from home is a thing I have two webcams open and visible on a monitor at all times, so that if things get to stressful I can just look at myself from multiple angles and remember how much prettier I am now.\n\nMaybe that makes me a narcissist. I don't fuckin' know. All I know is it's not hurting anybody and it makes me happy so that's good enough for me.",

You can try a travel sized trial (all you pay for is shipping) to see if you like it, and go from there.\n\nI\u2019ve changed my topical treatment a few times depending on concerns (at first it was acne of course, now it\u2019s mainly redness/PIH) and it\u2019s convenient and easy with quick response times.\n\nI take birth control now too which has amped up progress, although I know you don\u2019t want to take anything along the lines - just figured I\u2019d mention because curology was not the end all be all for me... it\u2019s still an ongoing process!\n\nFinally, I recommend cosdna.com for anything you try out. It lists ingredients and rates them depending on how irritating it may be for skin. YMMV though,  I\u2019ve had weird reactions to products with little to no harsh ingredients. Just know you\u2019re not alone!",

As always, use/buy the makeup that makes YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored. I do it for fun. \n\nPlease note, I am NOT a professional makeup artist, &amp; I make these to inspire looks for others, &amp; give myself a creative outlet.\n\n......\n\nBoxyCharm - Hello, Charmer! Palette \u270c\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udc41 Look Created: Triangle Cut Crease\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Packaging: each eyeshadow pan size is 1.4g, thin black &amp; white cardboard packaging, magnetic closure, medium rectangle shape, mirror inside, pans are not intended to be removable, shade names are below each shadow\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Country of Origin: Taiwan\n\n......\n\n\u26ab # of Shades in Palette: 12 eyeshadows\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Formulas Included: 3 formulas (5 mattes, 6 shimmers, 1 pressed glitter)\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Designation: neutral warm, w/ a pop of green/blue\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Type of Press: soft-press - lots of kickback in pan, some fallout on my face\n\n......\n\n\u26ab Extra Information: first-ever BoxyCharm-branded eyeshadow palette, cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, 12-month PAO\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Price: $39.00\n\ud83d\udcb2 Price: $3.25/shadow \n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udd0e REVIEW: \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fPatchiness: no patchiness \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fBlendability: everything blended easily together with the slightest effort \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fFallout: slight fallout w/ some shades; the most being from 'Spoiler' \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fShade Variance: there is a nice range of light, midtone, &amp; deep shades. There are also a few neutral transition shades for light/dark skin. \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fFormula: I was really impressed with the formula. The mattes are kind of powdery, but apply pigmented &amp; solid. The shimmers are smooth &amp; rich with color. The glitter actually has a base pigment, so it's nice to use on it's own for a pop of glittery color. There are no 'dud' shades. \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fPackaging: kind of cheap looking &amp; boring, not reminiscent of a $39 product \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fRecommendation: For an in-house brand palette, this is quite nice. I like it a lot. You can do a lot with it, &amp; the formula won't let you down. I personally believe this palette is heavily underrated. With all the beauty in the shimmers, this would be an excellent palette to keep around for 'special' going out/event looks. I like this palette enough to keep it in my collection.\n\n......\n\n+ Favorite Shade: Popup\n- Least Favorite Shade: Full Size\n\n......\n\n\ud83d\udea6 Rating: B",

You may need to actually connect an email to the site for these to register but idk, it's worth a shot.\n\nWith Paradox lucky stars idk what kind of coupons they have, but its $18 for 40 stars (my pack was actually missing a row or 2 but I got mine in a subscription box so who knows). No carrying case or anything, but there are more stars. I also like how these are black so you can see the gunk clearly.\n\nIf anyone knows some larger spots, let me know! The stars are a little small, and I loved the starface hello kitty spots because they were larger.",

If your hair is falling out and you've gained weight maybe you're not eating right, so start to pay attention to your diet. And I don't mean start a fad diet to lose weight, I mean watching you're eating enough nutrients to nourish your body. Working out will help you and boost your confidence so making it an habit could be a great thing. Also watch your water intake and make sure you're sleeping enough as well.\nTo look put together you can try using a tinted moisturizer and curling your lashes, or use some lipgloss. For me, perfume is a mood and confidence booster, even if it's something that doesn't reflect directly on your looks, smelling nice makes me feel great. \nYou're on your twenties, that's peak beauty for me! But in ten or twenty more years your beauty will still be there, it'll always be within you.",

If you\u2019re on a budget, The Ordinary is awesome. You can also sign up for an Allure Beauty Box and or the Dermstore sub. They send great products for close to nothing. \n\n2. But if you do have more budget... laser skincare is the bomb, girl. No cream will do for you what a laser can. \n\n3. Symmetry makes a huge difference. If you\u2019re on a budget, learn to fake it using makeup. If you have more money to spend, a reputable med spa can help you put things in place with Botox and fillers. \n\n4. What women aspire for our bodies to look like is totally different than what men are mostly attracted to. We will work our asses off in the gym to attain a perfect size 2 and what do men mostly like? Size 6-8 with curves. (But if you\u2019re naturally a 2 there are men out there who dig you too.) \n\nDo what makes YOU feel beautiful but if you\u2019re worried about being sexy enough, chances are you\u2019re closer to that goal than you think. \n\n5. My husband says I have a hot body (hello, E cup) but you know what I get a crazy amount of attention for? My feet. It\u2019s crazy. I can\u2019t post a cute shoe pic on Instagram without numerous men sliding into my DMs. I had a friend from high school ask if I could send him shoe pics, which I declined. WTH. If you want to be a sex bomb, keep your feet in top condition with a fresh pedi! \n\n6. A clean smile goes a long way as do white sparkly eyes. Get some beauty sleep and eye drops. If your budget allows, filler can hide your dark eye circles. I use concealer around my eyes as a primer and that\u2019s also an option. \n\n7. Waxing is great but a strong word of advice: get it professionally done, on schedule, 3-4 times. You want to get your hair on the same cycle and it will hurt less when you eventually DIY at home. We don\u2019t need another hero. Don\u2019t attempt a bikini wax at home if you\u2019ve never had wax before!",

            "body": "Hello!\n\nFirst off, kudos to you to trying to look better for yourself. No one is \"too ugly\" to put effort into their appearance, and you might find you feel a lot better about yourself once you do start putting effort into your appearance. I know I certainly don't feel good when I don't put into any effort and when I put in more, I definitely feel more confident. \n\nSo first, let's start with what you bring up first: **Body**. Working out is a great way to feel healthier and feel more confident in yourself. However, know that **if you already have body issues, they will not go away with becoming skinnier.** I learned this a while back, but once you are skinnier, you will just find something else to nitpick on your body so be mindful and accepting of yourself as you are. I would also recommend taking a women's multivitamin and drinking the correct amount of water as you suggested. Chloe Ting does have great workouts but they are mainly cardio. You might notice some slight muscle definition and gain but it'll plateau rather quickly.\n\nSecondly, **hormonal birth control can be very difficult to be on**! It's not so simple as starting it and it will magically reducing the one thing you want to reduce (though that would be nice). **It can give you acne, it can make you gain weight, it can make you depressed, and you will probably feel like shit for the first few months you start taking it.** I was personally really lucky with hormonal birth control and the first pill I started on worked just fine for me and had very little side effects, but I know more women who go on it and have pretty adverse side affects than those like me who don't. \n\nI personally manage body hair with a **hair trimmer, eyebrow razers, and shaving**. Waxing takes too much time imo and is rather annoying, but trimming is really easy and cuts the hair really short (albeit the hair will still be there). I trim some parts of my body hair (usually just my arms and I use the **ManScaped Lawn Mower 3.0**), shave my armpits and legs, and then use the eyebrow razers (these guys: [https://www.amazon.com/Tinkle-Eyebrow-Razor-Pack-6/dp/B014HNOXZS/ref=sr\\_1\\_7?crid=3GOJWRCAJNKY8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=eyebrow+razor&amp;qid=1611284937&amp;sprefix=eyebrow+raz%2Caps%2C309&amp;sr=8-7](https://www.amazon.com/Tinkle-Eyebrow-Razor-Pack-6/dp/B014HNOXZS/ref=sr_1_7?crid=3GOJWRCAJNKY8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=eyebrow+razor&amp;qid=1611284937&amp;sprefix=eyebrow+raz%2Caps%2C309&amp;sr=8-7)) to take the peach fuzz off my face. I also use the eyebrow razers to manage my brows a bit (usually only use them to take hairs off the top of them). I have never ever had an issue with these razer making my facial hair appear darker or thicker - it just comes back as peach fuzz every time.\n\nMoisturizing your body makes a HUGE difference in the texture and softness of your body's skin. I used to never do it and then randomly decided to and hoo boy there is such a difference. My recommendation is just find a thinner moisturizer with a pump (I like Jergen's, you can find them at any Walmart). I always moisturize before bed. I also use a Wet-Skin moisturizer after the shower (basically just a lotion you put on while still wet in the shower). I also use the Jergen's wet-skin moisturizer, really love it.\n\nOkay, now **let's move onto skin**. Skincare can kinda be trial and error, ngl. I've used so many products over the years. **What really helped me improve my skin quickly was Curology** ([https://curology.com/](https://curology.com/)). They do custom skincare treatments (basically just a cream you put on at home at night before moisturizer) and they really work. \n\nThe **basics of a skincare routine is cleanse, moisturize, and then protect** (AKA apply SPF in the morning). This is as basic as it gets. If you feel like you want or need more, then you can add more but it's not necessary. Find out what your skin type is and try out some products. If you're interested in Curology, do that first before buying other products because the dermatologists at Curology ask you to use products without other actives (actives are ingredients such as vitamin C, retinol, AHAs, BHAs, PHAs, etc.) in them.\n\nSPF is really important because sun exposure is the #1 cause of skin aging. Applying SPF daily (even on rainy, cloudy, snowy, non-sunny days) will help with your acne scars as well, as those often darken due to sun exposure. Your forehead being darker might be something you can fix, but it also might not be. Some people's skin just have different levels of pigmentation on different areas of their bodies and that's pretty normal if you have darker skin.\n\nAnd then **fashion,** this is really hard to give advice on ngl. Buy thing you like but you know you will actually wear. **Do not fall into that trap mentality you seem to have now, where once you look XYZ that you will be happier or love yourself more.** As I mentioned earlier, if you have body issues, they don't go away once you look a certain way. They will still be there, but maybe manifest in a different way than previous. Again, try to love and accept your body no matter the way it looks. Focus on what makes you feel good and healthy, and not how much you weigh or how your body looks.",

            "body": "Hello! First of all, congratulations for making the decision to be better and look better, and good luck on your journey!\nI'm a 24 year old female and I've had what you might call a glow up throughout my late teens and these early twenties. It has been a long journey but I've learned a lot. \nI can tell you that the first thing to learn about is self love, and whatever that might mean to you. For me it's been really important to me to acknowledge that I'm worthy of respect and love regardless of how I look like on the outside. \nWork on the inside will reflect on the outside. \nThe less I worried about losing weight the easier I lost it, because I focused more on how I felt and how to nourish and honour my body rather than in how it looked. \n\nNow, on to the more concrete advice, drinking enough water and a healthy diet will improve so much your skin, hair, and body overall. \nDoing the Chloe Thing challenges may or may not work for you, find a workout that you enjoy and it'll become an habit, don't do it just because it's popular.\nDon't focus too much on the befores and afters. The most important thing is that you'll become healthier and happier.\n\nSomething I do everyday is make a Gratitude list, helps me appreciate what I already have and who I'm already am.  I workout about 10 hours a week, but I don't worry too much if I miss a day or something, I try to eat healthy most of the time but I don't track calories and I've stopped restricting myself.   I also read a lot and listen to guided meditations  to nourish my mind along with my body. Someday I wear makeup and dress nicely and some days I don't even shower and just wear yoga pants and a hoodie, but on both of those days I feel happy and gorgeous. \nPlaying with my cat always brings me joy, cuddling with my SO brings me peace, teaching my students makes me feel productive, talking to my brother makes me feel grateful. It's all about the little things. \n\nYou do you, try to be your best self. Do it for you and just you.",

It\u2019s a little painful in the beginning but so so worth it. If you don\u2019t want to pay to get waxed every month this is a very nice alternative. My hair wouldn\u2019t grow back for a couple of weeks and when it did it would be very thin and soft whereas before it was sharp and dark.\nAs for your facial hair, I would recommend thread or wax! \n\nAlso, as a side of precaution, I would maybe get a blood test to rule out polycystic ovary syndrome. \nLike a few people have said, it could be genetics but wouldn\u2019t hurt to rule out PCOS.",

I\u2019m just asking because I grew up my whole life thinking I was so hairy compared to other women but actually it\u2019s because my hair just showed more due to the contrast from my hair and skin. If that\u2019s not the issue then I would suggest you watch some Alana Arbucci videos. She is very hairy and she talks about what she does to remove it. I just want to say that it gets better. Once you\u2019re a bit older you can do laser hair removal, electrolysis, bleach your arm and body hairs, etc. There are so many options. When I was your age, I used a dermaplaning razor for my upper lip. That helped me a lot.",

            "body": "I think you're right but I'd argue that every brand owner is like that. I mean Rihanna didn't create Fenty out of goodwill to mankind, bottom line is they all want to make money. It's why Rihanna used an SPF in her totally-not-an-add NIGHT routine for her get unready with me video, why Huda wears 80 billion products, why Gurus pack on product after product, following each with discount code etc. \n\nThese people benefit off us spending money we barely have on stuff we don't need. It's not good for your skin, for your appearance (some like a full beat but I certainly don't), your wallet, the environment (hello plastic waste!). It's only good for their mansions, their luxury cars, their private jets to islands.\n\nPretty much all personality-based brands want you to buy buy buy. Huda benefits when her customers buy loads of products, not just one or two. Hence the makeup gets crazier and crazier. Some of these influencers that these brand pages repost are starting to give Trixie Matell a run for her money. \n\nI only follow the brands where I specifically want to keep track of new releases, or I like their aesthetic. For that reason I mostly follow luxury brands with a more classy aesthetic lie Chanel, Dior, Guerlain, Rituel des Filles etc. Even if I can't afford a lot of their products I just like seeing well applied, classic makeup. These brands operate off the motto of \"less products, higher price\", whereas a lot of influencer brands operate off \"more products, medium price\". Similar profit margins but different way of getting there.\n\nI also follow influencers/content creators who've made minimalism, or more classic looks, their thing, like violet\\_fr and Lisa Eldridge. Other than these two, who are admittedly big, I also follow a lot of smaller people who aren't getting sponsorships and commissions yet because it's more authentic. You can just move on when they go down the my-page-is-an-add rabbit hole. \n\nAnyhow thanks for bringing this up because this needs to be discussed. Even if these are good people they are incredibly manipulative and are not out for our best interest. People need to realize that you don't need to buy or wear everything these people have, and often it doesn't even look good once you step away from a ringlight lol",

            "body": "Hello friend! I have depression and sleep problems as a result. My face is certainly not the best - no product can replace what good old-fashioned \"beauty sleep\" can do. However, there are some products, tips, and regimens that have helped me immensely. Hope this helps you too!\n\n* Retinol. Is. The. Best.   \nRetinol promotes skin regeneration, helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles, discoloration, and all sorts of other things. I've noticed a firming effect when I use products containing retinyl palmitate (aka retinol) even in small quantities from cheap brands. But of course, if you can afford better then purchase better. Just remember to use sunscreen every day!! Retinol makes your skin sensitive to sunlight. \n* Collagen supplements are helpful in skin regeneration.  \nPair it with a good vitamin C supplement and/or a multivitamin, and your skin will have the nutrients it needs to be healthy. \n* Use face masks regularly, especially moisturizing ones.   \nCucumber gel masks, aloe masks, and other cooling masks can be especially helpful in alleviating some of the puffiness and hot feelings around those tired eyes. Some days my eyes feel like they're on fire and begging for sleep but I just can't sleep. This helps me feel refreshed.\n* On that note, consider cooling eye drops. It helps with redness and dryness in the eyes, and can make them look more awake. \n* Moisturizers with hyaluronic acid act as a \"filler\", and can reduce the appearance of bags.  \nHyaluronic acid is fantastic under makeup because it plumps up the skin in a nice, natural way. I've noticed that this helps me with the bags under my eyes. It gives a smoother appearance to the skin, locks in moisture, and creates a great base for makeup. \n* Wash your face with the coldest water possible. Not only does it help tighten pores, but it wakes your face up and can bring some circulation back into it.\n* Facial massages increase blood flow to the face. I usually use a face roller after my hyaluronic acid moisturizer to stimulate circulation and make my face feel and look more awake. You can also just massage your face with your hands as you apply your moisturizer so that your fingers glide easily. It's a quick fix to making you look awake. \n\nHope these tips help. Good luck!",

The media portrayal of women with no hair/ folds/ fat/ skin/ texture is completely false. \n\nHowever, with that said, please also check for hormonal imbalance like PCOS or thyroid issues, if it's something that you think is a cause for concern and not normal. The medical term for abnormal hair growth is hirsutism. Hormonal issues are also sometimes accompanied by weight issues (difficulty losing weight, being overweight, being very underweight), acne, sleep difficulties. All the best!",

Totally normal. To ease it,Tea Tree Oil, Aloe Vera lotion or a good moisturiser will be a good idea to soothe it as your first time. It eases every time you wax, usually every 4-6 weeks depending on your regrowth rate.\nI've had leg, bikini waxing for years and it's all perfectly normal each time. Sleep on it, don't sunbathe for 24hours as is obviously sensitive, and it's gone the next day.\nThe brilliant thing about waxing is every time you wax, the hair growth becomes less and finer, so it then can be done less often.\nSo much less hassle than shaving stubble, especially on holiday with a blunt rasor!!\nWell done \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf79x",

Also the make of the perfume,ie, the price really does reflect the quality in this situation.\n\nChanel, YSL, Givenchy are the longest lasting due to being well made from Grasse in Provence, France. Personally I use 'Opium' ( Not Black Opium), parfum by YSL, a serious classic perfume with the price tag unfortunately to match (!!!), and literally two drops on your heat spots, behind ear and wrist last ALL day and then into evening when it has 'developed' on your skin, into a beautiful musky night scent. Everyone comments on how lovely it is and alluring!!!\nHope this helps. X",

In order to keep my hair from getting greasy I usually put my hair up in a bun, and then only wash my scalp. \n\nI do still wash the rest of my hair, but only about once a week, or if it somehow gets dirty. I use a gentle shampoo sparingly with lots of conditioner, and then use a leave in conditioner on everything below my scalp, with a focus on my ends. \n\nI also avoid brushing or combing my hair excessively. I also put my hair up in a bun when I\u2019m around the house so I\u2019m less tempted to play with or otherwise damage it. Also, I avoid using those little black hair ties since they tend to pull my hair out. Instead i use thick cloth scrunchies and things of that nature.",

I know it is recommended to train up-to 8 hours a day but I find this unnecessary- you can wear a trainer loosely (not super tight but tight enough where its still fitting around your waist snugly) around your waist while working out. Makes that area sweat much more! Do not continue wearing afterwards while it is wet, can cause issues for your bellybutton. \nAlso have an end goal and realize what is feasible for you. It may not be feasible to reach a 24 inch or waist but if you are very set just know it will take long. \nI personally dont train my waist anymore\u2014 was interested in it when I was younger and already achieved the results I wanted.",

(Idk if it will work as well for you, but I have sensitive skin and this worked for me!)\n\n\\- Minimise the amount of products used on my face and clarify them -- I use now mostly The Body Shop stuff, because my sensitive and combination skin really likes it! My routine is: The BS Seaweed cleanser, then a good witch hazel toner, then niacinamide from The Ordinary during the day, and tea tree or brightening serum from The BS at night, followed by The BS seaweed gel face moistueriser\n\n\\- Vitamin A supplements for the week before my period and the week of (as these can apparently only be taken for 2 weeks at a time -- ask your GP)\n\n\\- Really important: Niacinamide after toner and before face moisturizer during the day\n\n\\- Benzoyl peroxide on whiteheads/blackheads/bacne, and tea tree on the big red ones\n\n\\- Used a VERY GENTLE (!!!) exfoliating glove/pad on my face on the second cleanse, as I cleanse twice in the morning -- I did this in circular motions to clear my skin, and it works amazingly!!!\n\n\\- Last but not least, watch 'How I cured my adult acne' by Belinda Masri on Youtube (it won't let me post the link :( ) -- this video changed my life!!! I did everything she said, and it worked brilliantly! I went from a severely stressed-out gal with a crater face to being complimented on how clear it is regularly! I now rarely wear foundation!\n\nGood luck! I hope this stuff helps!!!",

            "body": "Hello! I know this must seem daunting for you but yay how exciting - you get to build an entire wardrobe from scratch! :) My tip would be to first identify your personal style - classic/ bohemian/ sporty etc. I would also suggest checking out Instagram account like minimalist wardrobe - some great visuals on the key basics to give you some ideas. And also do some searches on Pinterest for \"capsule wardrobes\" - I am always amazed by how many different looks can be put together with just a few key pieces. Someone suggested wrap dresses - and I 100% agree! Such an easy flattering style - you can wear with sandals in summer and trainers/ boots and chunky cardigans or sweaters in winter. My suggestions for \"wardrobe staples\" would be: white button down shirt, high waisted jeans, chunky cardigans in fun bright colours that you can wear over plain T-shirt's and also dresses, and accessorise with some fun chunky jewellery. Also a blazer in a bright colour is great to wear with neutrals, and get some fun heeled ankle boots - snakeskin or leopard or just plain back - they go great with jeans but also dresses and skirts :)\nDo reply if you have any more questions :)",

I'd actually suggest going to Lineas, it's a super cheap store and have some great pieces for young women, and you can try clothes on most stores. Another option could be Lefties, cheap as well and usually the employees don't care about what you pick. \nNow on the clothes, a good high waisted Jean never disappoints and flatters curves, you can get them on classic blue denim, a black one is a great choice too.  A loose dress with stockings and high heeled boots it's great for our not so cold weather. For accessories you could go to Forever 21 or Zara, I think these stores are available in most malls. Hope this helps, and you find something you feel comfortable and gorgeous in \u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "Hello! I hope I can offer some useful advice- \n\nfor false eyelashes, it is gonna take some practice. Having a good lash that has a flexible band helps a lot and then making sure the glue is almost dry before applying. Looking down and placing the inner part of the eye first because the outer corner is easier and if the lash isn\u2019t in a comfortable spot in the inner corner, it can cause her eyes to water. Then when the the lash is where she wants it, gentle push her real and false lashes together. I remember when my mom and I were learning to do false lashes that we would apply too much glue and didn\u2019t wait for it to dry and we would end up gluing my eyes shut lol its a funny memory her and I share today.  \n\nFor eye shadow, cream eye shadows are a good place to start because you can draw it where you want it to be and then blend with your fingers. A good bronze cream eye pencil is a good one to have- just make sure to blended right away or the color will set and you won\u2019t be able to blend the edges. When I was getting use to blending, I would practice with my face bronzer so I\u2019d learn where I like to put my crease and how to get a soft blend and using bronzer helped so the colors would not be so harsh and it would blend without any effort since it was a soft powder. For good nude colors, medium browns and golds are the way to go because they look flattering on all eye colors. \n\nnikkietutorials just posted a video on makeup hacks that may be useful to look at if you\u2019re interested- I hope you both have fun! My favorite memories of makeup are always with my mom and I think it\u2019s super special that you two are learning together &lt;3",

I think I\u2019m just tired of gourmands right now for some reason? I have and like but don\u2019t use much now, Black Orchid Tom Ford, V&amp;R Flowerbomb and Bonbon. I like perfumes that are both long lasting and moderate-strong sillage. Seem to be craving clean fresh scents for the last 9 months.. price not an issue, niche is great (something like Chloe Sevigny Little flower, I haven\u2019t had a chance to smell it yet but love the idea of having a scent less widely available)(also part of reason V&amp;R Flowerbomb is just not doing it for me anymore). \n\nAlso, perfumes I\u2019ve had in the past but no longer interested in: D&amp;G light blue and Dolce, Versace Bright Crystal, Gucci Envy Me, DKNY be delicious, Ferragamo signorina. \n\nIf you have any suggestions for something, would love to hear it, thank you!!",

            "body": "Hello!! So a tip that I do that really helps me manage my hair in general is this:\n1. Wash your hair at night (I let my hair air dry and to prevent damage from a blow dryer)\n2. Next morning, spray in some dry shampoo (I just use Batisse from Target - the yellow tropical scented one). This will give your hair texture and some grip for the braids. It will also allow you to go 2-3 days between washes because your hair won\u2019t get greasy.\n3. Start braiding (follow YouTube as suggested). I know I should write steps out here but honestly I\u2019m not a word person, but a visual person so I recommend that.\n4. Finish with a light hairspray. \n\nFinally, I just want to say to be easy on yourself. You\u2019re absolutely beautiful and just keep practicing. Have fun with it! \ud83d\ude18",

A few months ago I purchased it for the first time since I know so many people absolutely love it, so I thought I\u2019d give it a try. I must say the formula is great and gives really nice coverage; however, I ran into this issue where the concealer would be squeezed out the top of the part that pushes it down to force it up the tube to the sponge, causing a lot of product to get trapped and become inaccessible (without trying to completely take it apart haha).\n\nIs this a common issue people run into? Or is it just something wrong with the one I have? I wanted to hear from others about this so I can take that into account when considering repurchasing. Thanks! :)",

Kind of panicking here because I can\u2019t tell if I have a cold sore or not. \n\nSunday morning my lips were super dry (as always) so I periodically coated them in Vaseline (as always) only to notice that my upper right lip area had cracked and peeled and was tingly. \n\nWoke up Monday with the first pic - yellow scabby blister thing? Lip area around became red and was tingly all day. I went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist told me it is a cold sore and to use Abreva. But the blister fell off and was gone by dinner time? And the lip skin beneath is smooth?\n\nToday (Tuesday) I woke up with nothing, just the tingle tingles and the lip area is still just a bit red and tighter than usual. \n\nIs this a cold sore? I thought they lasted several days? Not 24 hours? Or is it just the cracked lip that has begun to heal?\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: Sorry for my mustache hairs, I self-waxed my upper lip recently and missed quite a few :(",

My hair is very frizzy and thick, but the perms are what kind of fixed it for me.  \nWhen I have a curly/wavy perm, I always have to let my hair air dry/blow dry it after washing it (like not sleeping on it wet haha), because it will be messy the next day if I don\u2019t.\nMy most recent perm lasted a reallyyyy long time.  I think maybe 2 years?  This might be because of my hair texture though (my sister has pin straight hair and hers lasted a little less than mine).\nAlso, I personally think my perm looks better after about half a year.  I guess more natural looking??\nI hope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello! Fellow \u2018too skinny\u2019 girl here.\n\nI second the person that recommended lowering your sodium intake. Also whatever healthy habits you enjoy, practice them consistently over this coming week. Knowing that you\u2019re putting in the effort to take care of yourself will help you feel and look happier and prettier. For me it\u2019s starting the day with healthy smoothies (nut butters and avocado provide wholesome healthy fats) and doing a couple blogilates videos. For the hair i would recommend a deep condition treatment. Either from the drugstore or with coconut or olive oil. My favorite easy makeup is a light mineral foundation, mascara and tinted lip balm. If you\u2019ll be in the water I feel that ruched/ribbed one-pieces Can suit our body type better than a bikini does. Just something to consider. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far I just want to encourage you to not be so hard on yourself over your body type! I used to feel so crushed when people would comment on my weight, asking if I was bulemic or if I had considered eating more. I even had a friend call me knobbly-kneed like freaking Harry Potter. I don\u2019t know your age but for me as I\u2019ve entered my mid twenties I care less about what others may think of my body type and just appreciate my little body for keeping me going this far lol. Your boyfriend obviously likes you as you are and will just be happy to spend time with you. Hope you have fun!",

Grad school has been tough, especially with trying to conduct research throughout a pandemic. \n\nFor those interested in an interview, I will be reaching out shortly to start scheduling for this weekend and the next several weeks to come. I will be interviewing to get to know you better as well as have a better understanding of your experiences. If I do not reach out to you in the next two weeks, I may reach out towards the end of October as I will need help with user testing on my prototype and I hope I can share some of your time then to get this project up and running! \n\nI will keep you guys updated on the project results :D Thank you again for all your help and support! I hope you and your loved ones all stay safe. With love.",

Granted, that is if you are taking care of your skin correctly. \n\nA good cleanser (make sure to double cleanse) moisturizer, and sunscreen should work well for most people. A good glycolic or salicylic acid cleanser should help if you need mild exfoliation along the way. \nIf you absolutely need an active, I'd start out with a good quality vitamin C serum.

            "body": "Hello dear!!\n\nThere are a few things to go over. \n\nFor amab people, their brow bone tends to be lower over the eyes and more prominent (and thicker) than those afab.  There is also a bit of difference in the forehead altogether. AMAB people to have more sloping foreheads while afab tend to be more vertical and rounded.   \nAs well, afab people tend to have thinner (less dense) and lighter eyebrow hair that usually has a distinct arch. AFAB will, usually, have their brow bone exposed at the peak of the arch and towards the end (think brow bone highlight). Meanwhile, most amab people will have their eyebrows covering their brow bone.   \n\n\nI HIGHLY suggest you watch videos like Cosmo Queen. The series shows very clearly how amab people construct more 'feminine' features. You'll notice a lot of the things I discussed, though it's a bit more exaggerated that what would be useful for everyday looks. They cover their eyebrows and then draw them higher and use a heavy brow highlight to imitate a brow bone. Highlight the forehead to make it more pronounced (to visually bring it forward).   \nI think there's a lot you can take and use from the videos to help you along your journey.   \n\n\nHope this helps!! \u2764",

It is the only FDA approved treatment for permanent hair REMOVAL. For example, when transgender folk get their genital surgery this is the hair removal they get to permanently destroy the follicles in their skin on their bikini/crotch before the surgery is done (because there\u2019s a lot of skin grafting in those procedures and they can\u2019t have active hair follicles growing on/in grafted skin). It is permanent.\n\nI am getting it done on my bikini at the moment and the results are fantastic after just a few sessions. It hurts like a mother but I have never felt smoother/sexier. I would recommend looking into this if you\u2019re serious about hair removal.

(Hello 1995!). They\u2019ve come a long way from the press on nails of our adolescence! There are glue on types, and a kind with a built in adhesive - they both look great and feel super secure to me. Only downside with the adhesive type is that they start to lift a little after a few days so they\u2019re not super long lasting. But I recently had a glue on set for almost 2 weeks, only took them off b/c my real growth was showing. \n\nI used to get regular manicures, but that seems like an unnecessary trip during Covid times. I also have a 3yo and a 3mo so I never feel like painting them myself and waiting for them to dry. The strips and press ons have been great for me these last few months!",

            "body": "I had the same problem when I first started wearing blush! I have fair skin with pink leaning undertones, so whenever I wore pink or peach toned blush, my cheeks looked REALLY pink, and not in a good way lol. I discovered that orange and brown toned blushes look so much better on me because instead of just highlighting my pink undertones, they bring warmth to my skin and give me a more sunkissed, glowy look! I\u2019m not sure if going against your undertones is the proper makeup technique, but it works amazingly for me. Another thing you could do is watch how much you\u2019re putting on. I don\u2019t wanna waste my pink blush, so I just apply the tiniest amount and I always wear foundation or at least a skin tint underneath so it doesn\u2019t just look like I\u2019m adding to the unevenness of my skin tone. Placement helps too! I apply it higher up towards my temple and not so much directly on the apples of my cheeks to help contour my face. If I apply too much on my apples you look at my face and it\u2019s just like HELLO BLUSH and not much of anything else. I absolutely love orange blushes though! It seems counterintuitive cause like, no one blushes orange naturally, but they look much more fitting on me. Good luck!",

I would also recommend a simple rose hydrosol with glycerine as a pick-me up, and some tinted lip balms from Sugar. They are wonderfully moisturizing chapsticks but the color feels very luxurious and put together.  I'm not sure if she enjoys perfumes, but a simple one with clean ingredients might be nice for something that she can appreciate just for herself. Again, I wish her and you all the best.",

Well I can say that getting out of my previous relationship was the first step, it was a very toxic environment and next was doing and picking up activities that I loved, but stopped doing because of depression helped immensely. These include painting, sketching and exercise, they all kinda functioned as outlets and helped my self esteem. Also doing things by yourself like going to the movies, sitting down at a cafe and reading a good book while drinking coffee and occasionally treating yourself to little gifts from you to you gives a feeling of small fulfillments that make a positive difference in your day.

            "body": "Hello, dentist here who also has bruxism.\n\nHere's the vicious circle. You're stressed, you clench your jaw in your sleep because your brain needs a way out. That's temporal and masseter muscles doing that. Then you keep being stressed. Keep clenching your jaw. The more you clench your jaw, the more these muscles work, and the stronger they become. The stronger they become, the more you clench your jaw, and the stronger they become.\n\nThis needs to be stopped because of two very important reasons:\n1) The clenching erodes your teeth. I've seen people with 1/3rd left of their teeth because of this. It's aesthetically not pleasing, and it's literally your teeth eroding away.\n2) Our jaw joint is a crazy one. The only thing protecting the joint is One Disc in between two bones (mandibular bone and temporal bone) and when you clench your jaw, obviously, you also put a lot of pressure into this disc. Because you're literally pushing your mandibular bone upwards. In time, and this is a relatively short time, you will slowly misplace this disc, and then start eroding it a little. What you will experience first is there will be some pain. Then you will start hearing clicking when you open your mouth or when you chew. Then you will have a lot of pain when you chew. There is more to follow that if you don't get treatment for it. Right now, also because of underlying joint issues, my jaw joint does this thing where it momentarily displaces and then moves back into place. In time, my jaw might stop working completely.\n\nThe first time I was offered a nightguard was roughly six years ago. Different stuff happened and I wasn't able to get proper treatment so I just stopped looking for one, and now I'm here.\n\nWhat botox does is that it disables your muscle cells, so a bunch of your masseter muscle fibers will stop working for a few months. This will lead to these muscle fibers losing strength. Which will lead to less clenching and less damage and after a few appointments, you will have significantly reduced this damage taken.\n\nNow I'm sure it's expensive, because botox is a bit expensive. I don't know what the condition of your muscles are. In some cases, a botox treatment is extremely crucial, because the muscles are already really big and strong. We use botox first, and after a few months we switch to botox and nightguard, in those cases. In some cases, a nightguard is given and then the patient will be followed to see if there is improvement. Your dentist is the one to decide that.\n\nIn addition, what a nightguard does is that it moves your mandibular bone just a bit further away from the joint disc, so when you clench, there's less pressure on it. It also protects your teeth from eroding. So it doesn't stop the clenching, it's just a protective measure. In most cases that's enough. In my case, I clench so bad I break my nightguards.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions, ask away!\n\nEdit: botox on your masseter muscle, if done correctly, won't affect your expressions because it's not a muscle that has any role in facial expressions.",

            "body": "Hello fellow former nail biter!\n\nSo everytime a question like this comes up I race to recommend my holy trail product, not only because it works but also because I was suspicious af before I tried it and almost didn't.\n\nhttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutra-Nail-5-To-7-Day-Growth-with-Calcium-and-Protein-Nail-Treatments-0-45-oz/10451743 \n\n(Sorry for ugly link, I'm on mobile)\n\nI used to get it on Amazon but it's not as consistently stocked anymore. Anyway, you apply it 3 times a day, which I found to be the tipping point where you really see results. It takes about 5-10 minutes to soak in so it's a bit of a commitment, but you can carefully use a computer or phone during. And you need to apply it thickly, I would fully load the brush for each nail and make sure to go over the entire nail including cuticle. \n\nHonestly I have no idea if it has any effect on growth speed, I don't think so? But it noticeably improves nail strength/hardness. I mean we're nail biters, we know exactly how hard our nails are from chomping them, and using this 100% makes them harder.\n\nAnother tip is don't fight with the bottle when it gets low, just set it aside and get another one. When the second one gets low, take the first and pour it into the second. Viola, usable again.",

            "body": "Hello. I was in Mexico when my adult teeth were coming in. When they did come in, my front teeth were stained a very dark yellow. My dentist believed it was the fluoride in the drinking water found in Mexico, the condition is also known as \u201cfluorosis\u201d my case was considered extreme. After years of bullying and crying to my parents about it I had my teeth fixed as a sophomore in high school. I first had to straighten my teeth which took about two years but I didn\u2019t mind because the brackets covered most of the stains. After that my dentist whitened my teeth, or at least tried to. The stains were still very prominent so she ended up having to shave my stained teeth down and then applying bonding on top of them. It was a long costly process but I am very grateful to my parents for it. My life and confidence since then changed dramatically. I know veneers might also be an option but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s even more expensive. Best of luck.",

Causing the tea tree to build up and cause more irritation. Like some have mentioned,  for dry scalp I use Head and Shoulders Deep Conditioning Shampoo and Conditioner. Again I only wash my hair maybe once or twice a week. Make sure to condition only the ends and mid shaft of your hair with a Leave-in conditioner after you shower.

            "body": "Hello, fellow Eastern European :)\n\nAlcohol damages the natural protective barrier of your skin, leaving it more fragile and dehydrated. If it is the primary ingredient of the remedy you have, I\u2019d not recommend using it.\n\nResearch shows that you will get much better results with chemical exfoliation. Products with BHA and AHA can be real game changers. Topical retinoids are harsher but can be even more effective. \n\nYou should look for estheticians or dermatologists that use these principles in their practice. It is a sign that they keep up with the latest trends in dermatology. Asking them about their opinion on sun protection also is a good competence test. If they do not take this issue seriously, it is a red flag. I think that finding a competent specialist is the best scenario because they will know what to do, and you\u2019re likely to see the results quickly.\n\nDepending on the seriousness of your problem and your desire to process new information and take risks, you can learn about this stuff on your own and create your own skincare routine. R/skincareaddiction may be a good starting point.\n\nAlso, stay away from doctors who recommend detox.",

            "body": "As a HEAVILY depressed autistic person, I'm the same! My method is to add one thing at a time. \n\nWhen I wake up every morning I have to pee, so as I'm washing my hands afterwards I force myself to brush my teeth. I found that making it accessible really helped; instead of having my toothbrush in a cabinet, I got something that hangs on my mirror (it grosses me out when my toothbrush is just in the open air because when you flush the toilet, particles go everywhere. This grossout factor was ANOTHER thing preventing me from brushing \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nThen after brushing once in the morning was more of a habit, I started forcing myself to brush before I went to bed. I can't sleep without chapstick because my lips get really dry, so I put my chapstick in the bathroom to lure myself in there, then I guilt myself into brushing.\n\nWhen that felt more routine I worked on showering more often, which is hard for me because while the shower itself is great, I have sensory issues around being OUT of the shower and still being damp. To tackle this I leave a towel for myself in the bathroom so I can't forget it, and I set up a cozy spot away from my bed (wet pillowcase is the WORST) where I can lay my hair out to dry, which keeps it away from my body and makes it a little easier to bear. I reward myself with something really good to enjoy while my hair dries: A favorite snack, 30 minutes of reading a great book, whatever. \n\nThe point is, treat your depression like a wild animal that lives with you and that you have to work around. Leave traps for it. Be prepared for its inevitable victories; forgive yourself for those. Keep in mind that the depression won this battle, but it will lose the war. Know your enemy's method of attack and prepare for it:\n\nCan't get out of bed? Nightstand contains snacks that leave minimal crumbs, sealed in Tupperware to prevent bugs. \nCan't bring yourself to shower? Sanitary wipes for your pits and genitals are a lifesaver. I have baby wipes 'cause I'm real sensitive.\nCan't eat? Snacks like peanuts, dry cereal, chips, etc are key. Tell yourself you only have to eat one. That wasn't so bad. Think you can handle five? What about ten?\nOvereating? Separate your food into portions. Small ones. Force yourself to take only one at a time. When you finish it, see if you can wait five minutes before going to get the next one. Or even one minute, and then you can work your way up.\n\nThe best asset you can have is someone who's willing to check on you. Who's kind to you and allows you to backslide and screw up, but isn't an enabler. If you don't have a person like that, BE THAT PERSON. Schedule little events in your phone. \n\nReminder: Have you showered today? \n\nReminder: It's cool to be full of a billion cells that are all working to keep you alive. All those cells think you're worth something. They don't care about your GPA or the size I'd your paycheck or whatever. They deserve a reward. Drink a small cup of water.\n\nReminder: No matter how much of a piece of shit you think you are, dogs you pass on the street still strain on their leashes to say hello to you because they want to meet you and be your friend SO BADLY, and that's worth something. \n\nReminder: Brush your teeth! One minute per row! That's only ten seconds per section! Brushing your teeth is the only time you clean your skeleton! That's kind of cool!\n\nReminder: Fresh sheets are so incredibly blissful. Wash one pillowcase at a time, I don't care, but try to wash your sheets today! \n\nReminder: Washing your face is annoying, but it's fun to draw little smiley faces in the soap before you rinse. Just a thought :)\n\nWhen no one was there for me, I learned how much I love and appreciate myself. Everyone you know will let you down sometimes, and that's okay! You'll let them down too, and that's also okay! But that means YOU have to be there for you. Even if you feel like it doesn't matter or you're not worth it, thinking of yourself as your best friend who you're kinda mad at or disappointed in but who you still love and want to be happy, is your BEST weapon. Even if you can only do the bare minimum, your best friend is worth any effort you can give, even if it's eating five peanuts and drinking a cup of water. The more tiny things you do, the better you'll feel, and then you can do bigger things, like starting to work out and learning how to do something new and finishing old projects that have been collecting dust for years. Recovery isn't a destination, it's a journey, and every single step counts!",

            "body": "Hello! I\u2019ve been on Biotin supplements for almost 2 months now. Along with that I made a cuticle serum form essential oils! My nails are growing crazy fast now, I have to cut them down weekly! For the cuticle serum:\n\n1 teaspoon of coconut oil - (I use the Virgin kind, I melt it in the microwave) coconut oil is great for not only growing your nails but making them strong\n\n1 teaspoon of jojoba oil - great for nourishing nails and repairing damaged collagen inside the nail bed \n\n3 drops of tea tree oil - antifungal to keep your nails from infection\n\n3 drops of vitamin E oil - moisturizes the nails and cuticle, also prevents yellowing of the nails if you paint them a lot! \n\nI give these oils a good mix and put it in one of those travel containers you usually put your eye creams on. I apply it three times a day. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "body": "Hello, I have a contrasting idea as I don\u2019t recommend IPL as they won\u2019t really have long term results in shortest amount of time. What I did was to get a package of DIODE LASER for 8 sessions. It has dramatically improved my pits, I can testify. About 80-90% stoppage of hair growth on my 8th session. I availed another 8 sesh package for the remaining 10-20% of hairs which grows/shows-up obviously only after 3-6 months. Today, my last session (9th session) was December last year and I only have around 25 strands or so of visible hair. And they\u2019re not the thick ones like they used to be. \n\nThe diode laser has higher frequency which the derma uses and increases per session. The recommendation was to return every 5 weeks for the next session to occur. And the procedure last around 45 mins. \n\nIt\u2019s a better investment for me with real results. Rather than spending on an IPL DIY which 1. May be expensive 2. May not work 3. May damage your skin further as not all equipments are calibrated/users qualified to do it.\n\nHope you find your best pit solution. Good luck. \ud83d\ude42",

            "body": "Hello, I agree with the other posters - gently exfoliate beforehand (a washcloth/loofah will do it, or one of those gorgeous DIY suggestions someone made. Sugar, salt or fresh coffee grounds mixed with coconut oil or even any body lotion you have lying around is fine), and then every couple of days. I stress please do this gently!!  \n\nYou'll definitely get faster with time :) Take it really slowly for now though, especially around your knees and ankles. I recommend trying one of the razors with a solid lotion attached around the blade. You don't even then really need to use any gel or anything then and it is way harder to cut yourself so you can move more confidently /quickly. But if you want a bit of extra lubrication you just need something cheap - shampoo, conditioner or a light body lotion is ideal.\n\nDefinitely moisturise afterwards, and every day - this will probably have the most impact. Great if you can use a lotion with tea tree oil as that is soothing &amp; antibacterial &amp; will help with any ingrown hairs that may come about. Though if you follow the routine of gentle exfoliation every 2-3 days, and moisturise daily, you should avoid any issues! Good luck!! \n\nI'm an ex beauty therapist and in general I really believe in waxing legs as a) someone else does it for you and b) it lasts longer. But I wouldn't try that til you're a bit older. It hurts at first and can be quite confronting. Just try to be patient...as with everything, practise makes perfect!! You'll get there!",
