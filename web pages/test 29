            "body": "Hello! First, using toner + 20 volume might not work too well. Toner in general isnt good for lightning as its deposit-only color. Now, it has technically lightened my hair with 20 vol in past experiments keeling it on for a while, but my hair lightens crazy easy so its not a good judge of \"normal\". If you want absolute surety that itll turn out lighter, use bleach again. Id deep condition it today. And as long as its still healthy and strong, Id bleach it tom (without touching the roots with bleach or waiting till last 5 min so you dont get hotroots) --&gt; then use toner + volume 10 developer --&gt; then use conditioner, and not wash hair for at least 3 days afterwards. \n\nThere is not set timeframe for whem you can bleach or dye hair. However, just make sire your hair can take a bit more damage and still feel healthy. Whether thats 1 hour or 5 months. If it need a lot of moisture or some protein consider focusing on damage control and then color.  Oh and purple shampoo/conditioner are just used for maintenance, they wont actually change/fix your hair color. Id save your money for more toner in a few month's touch-up. Good luck!",

It's like people feel like they are obligated to be like, \"Hello gorgeous!\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\" Or \"Beautiful \u2665\ufe0f\" or whatever whether they actually think that or not. Honestly sometimes I just don't feel like I need to be validated for my appearance in this particular way, which is super generic and non-specific. It seems so fake. I would honestly rather hear something like \"wow you look so confident!\" or \"your hair looks really nice!\" Because at least it's something about me as a person. When guys post pics of themselves it's more likely to be their friends making dumb jokes or whatever. And honestly I would rather hear that than anything. I think the assumption is that every female has self esteem completely based on her physical beauty so if you tell her she's pretty/hot/beautiful/cute you are building her up. But we can have self esteem based on talent and taste in media and sense of humor and creativity too, just like guys.",

This is just my opinion and I'm up for a healthy discussion as I am also very curious.\n\nI work in the beauty industry and I've been here for a quite a while to know why the beauty industry is so successful.\n\nFor some women, I mean, sometimes, even I would admit to this, there are times when there is an emotional need we need to fill that only feeling pretty can fix. Even if it's not really the solution to my problem.\n\nIf i feel down because of a family issue, I turn to a salon to get a haircut or what not. \n\nAlso, the media is so manipulative. You know how they say that even the girl in the magazine, doesn't look like the girl in the magazine? It's true. I work a lot with ads as well and when we do people's makeup, they still find a way to make these models look even better than they do in real life and it sets such an impossible standard. \n\nI know, it's all in my perception. But sometimes, I can't help but also feel inadequate because I am not as pretty as them. And as a cult, women just try to empower each other by saying that we are all beautiful and gorgeous and what not so we don't feel like we are inadequate. \n\nI hope that makes sense. There's so much more to discuss. but I hope this helps.",

            "body": "Drink lots of water! I have an app that reminds me to drink water every 2 hours (but I try to drink water every hour). **1. SKIN:** I noticed a difference in my skin's health - Drinking lots of water along with a good skin routine works wonders. My lips are soft and plump and my face livens up when I keep well hydrated. **2. DIGESTIVE HEALTH:** Water improves digestive health (it keeps things moving along, helping with constipation) which I have been experiencing and loving. Your bowels NEED water to function properly. **3. WEIGHT LOSS:** Drinking lots of H2O increases your body's metabolism which aides in losing weight. You also lose weight if you replace sugary drinks with water (hello, ZERO calories!). Make sure to drink water about half hour before meals because it can prevent overeating (guilty) by making you feel full sooner. **4. SECRETIONS:** Your body needs water in order to produce saliva (which is 99% water, helps us digest our food, and keeps the mouth moist) and mucus (which keeps nose and eyes moist, helping against friction). **5. ORAL HEALTH:** Water helps keep the mouth clean. When water is consumed instead of sugary drinks, it can reduce tooth decay. Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities and make your teeth stronger.\n\nThere are soooo many more benefits of drinking water, so I encourage you to do some research and be amazed :)\n\nMake sure you look up a water intake calculator online to find out what your daily intake should be (usually based on your age, gender, height, and weight). Too much water is bad for you, so you want to be right in that sweet spot.",

            "body": "Hello! You sound like you, personally, aren't that interested in makeup and instead are looking to wear it to stop those comments. That makes me really upset on your behalf, first of all they are wrong for making those comments and second of all you should never wear makeup for someone else, makeup is great but you should only wear it because you like it and want to wear it.\n\nWhat I would suggest instead, is look into skincare. Learning about your skin (the type it is, what works for it and what doesn't) will pay dividends later in life. Also, I would suggest you respectfully ask why they care. Don't be rude, don't get sassy, just say it like \"I actually like my face :) Why would I want to change it?\" Hopefully one or both of these suggestions will get them off your back, which I think is your main goal. The second suggestion would be considered \"standing up for yourself\" which is another thing that's great to learn how to do as it will pay off later in life.\n\nFor reference, I am in my twenties and I wear makeup maybe once or twice per month. I love my skincare routine, its really simple (I am lazy lol) and I like how it makes my skin look.",

I also really like the Simply Protecting Moisturizer with SPF. The Citrus Day Gel is what i bought to replace the Garnier Skin Active Moisture Rescue Gel and if you couldn't find the Earth to Skin I'd recommend the Garnier one. All of those can be found at Walmart and probably other places but I always grab mine when I'm at Walmart. \n\nMakeup: \n\nEssence Super Last liquid liner or any Essence liquid liner. Their mascaras are good too even though I don't have any currently. \n\nNyx Bare With Me foundation, Hydratouch primer, On The Rise Volume Mascara, and the Perfect Filter shadow palettes are awesome. Also pretty much any of the Soft Matte Lip Cremes are amazing. And their setting sprays are pretty good too, especially the dewy one. \n\nBert's Bees All Aglow Lip &amp; Cheek sticks are my favorite blushes ever if you like cream blush but the E.L.F studio blush is great if you like powder. \n\nRevlon Super Lustrous Lipsticks are amazing, the formulas are all pretty good no matter if its matte or satin finish, they're pretty cheap and there's like a billion colors to choose from. \n\nCovergirl CGSmoothers is my favorite BB cream, I think its the perfect ratio of feeling like there's nothing there at all to tint of color. Its also pretty sweatproof and my go to for outdoor activities that I still want to wear makeup to. \n\nWet and Wild eyeshadow primer is fantastic, no creasing or loss of color and it stays all day, and their Hello Halo liquid highlighters are really good. The applicator for the highlighters is kinda stupid (giant doe foot, why is it so big) but the formula itself is great. Also the E.L.F. jelly highlighter is awesome, very pretty and buoldable and also fun to touch. \n\nAlso Simply has really good makeup remover wipes and miscellar water.",

            "body": "Hello! Before I go into advice, I just wanna say that were a little bit mislead these days about what our skin and our makeup is supposed to look like. All the porcelain skin and perfect foundation we see online is most definitely face tuned, because it's impossible to look like glass as a human being. \n\nSecondly, I would look into a better foundation and primer. You didn't mention the brand which you were using but if you're looking for a good dewy foundation I would recommend wet n wild, loreal, Maybelline, elf, and nyx as good places to start for drugstore and my personal favorite dewy foundation is the fenty hydrating foundation!\n\nYou will want to focus more on creams and balms instead of powders for your blush, contour, and highlighting, and a good dewy setting spray is also a great key!\n\nIf you don't feel like getting a new foundation, you could mix some moisturizer in with your bb cream and that might help! As for not using a beauty blender or brush, listen to your derm, but if it's making you unhappy you could always use a brush or blender and clean it extremely well before and after use. \n\nHope this helped!!!",

Secondly, mechanical exfoliation is the devil! Third for a sanitary perspective.....after you wash where do you store it? In your bathroom where bacterias are flying around with every flush of the toilet? I am sorry to tell you; there is no up side here, it\u2019s all around a bad idea\n\nAnd yes, there are bacteria everywhere. That\u2019s why we typically distinguish between good and bad bacteria. In this case, I was clearly talking about bad bacteria, the kinds you do NOT want on your face. I dIdn\u2019t think I needed to specify. \n\nA loofah is NOT a gentle method of scrubbing one\u2019s face!!!! If she talked about using this on the body, I honestly wouldn\u2019t care as much because the skin on the body is thick, can withstand mechanical scrubbing and is less likely to breakout from bacterias. The skin on the face on the other hand is very thin. A loofah is too harsh for the face. I honestly don\u2019t know anyone who uses a loofah on their face. \n\nUsing your clean hands and fingers is actually more environmental friendly. \n\nI am not being negative. I hate bad beauty advice, especially bad skin care advice. I wish someone would have told me these things in my teen years when I first became interested in skincare. So if one 16 year old reads this and learn something about skincare, I would sleep better tonight. \n\nIt may seem to you that you\u2019re supporting \u201csomeone\u2019s talent\u201d but at the end of the day bad skincare advice is more harmful, it can ruin people\u2019s skin, their self-esteem, cause dysphoria...and so on. This is a bad idea. If you want to support her, by all means buy it, as a gentle cloth for a baby, to wash your body..etc. but please do not use on your face. That\u2019s all.",

I used to floss inconsistently but when I started doing it religiously my teeth looked way whiter. I limited my consumption of tea and coffee for a good year or so and my teeth definitely look whiter. I use a charcoal toothpaste from Hello sometimes (like maybe 2 times a week) and I find that it doesn\u2019t necessarily help longterm but it does make your teeth appear whiter for a day or so after using.

I use tampons, but during heavier periods i dont go a lot on those either. The prospect of changing/refreshing only twice per day sounds brilliant.  Also how you all have described things have really taken my horrified feeling away.\nI think i might sound silly,  but just the other day, i had a bad experience with tampons.  I was quite upset at the prospect of having to use pads in future.\nYour comments have made me feel so much better is what im trying but failing, to explain briefly! \ud83d\ude01\nThankyou all very much \nI wish you all a wonderful day. \ud83d\ude0a",
