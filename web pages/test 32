It is the only FDA approved treatment for permanent hair REMOVAL. For example, when transgender folk get their genital surgery this is the hair removal they get to permanently destroy the follicles in their skin on their bikini/crotch before the surgery is done (because there\u2019s a lot of skin grafting in those procedures and they can\u2019t have active hair follicles growing on/in grafted skin). It is permanent.\n\nI am getting it done on my bikini at the moment and the results are fantastic after just a few sessions. It hurts like a mother but I have never felt smoother/sexier. I would recommend looking into this if you\u2019re serious about hair removal. You\u2019re just throwing good money after bad with the laser (most of the time. different lasers will likely produce better results in diff people) X",

There are glue on types, and a kind with a built in adhesive - they both look great and feel super secure to me. Only downside with the adhesive type is that they start to lift a little after a few days so they\u2019re not super long lasting. But I recently had a glue on set for almost 2 weeks, only took them off b/c my real growth was showing. \n\nI used to get regular manicures, but that seems like an unnecessary trip during Covid times.

I have fair skin with pink leaning undertones, so whenever I wore pink or peach toned blush, my cheeks looked REALLY pink, and not in a good way lol. I discovered that orange and brown toned blushes look so much better on me because instead of just highlighting my pink undertones, they bring warmth to my skin and give me a more sunkissed, glowy look! I\u2019m not sure if going against your undertones is the proper makeup technique, but it works amazingly for me. Another thing you could do is watch how much you\u2019re putting on. I don\u2019t wanna waste my pink blush, so I just apply the tiniest amount and I always wear foundation or at least a skin tint underneath so it doesn\u2019t just look like I\u2019m adding to the unevenness of my skin tone. Placement helps too! I apply it higher up towards my temple and not so much directly on the apples of my cheeks to help contour my face. If I apply too much on my apples you look at my face and it\u2019s just like HELLO BLUSH and not much of anything else. I absolutely love orange blushes though! It seems counterintuitive cause like, no one blushes orange naturally, but they look much more fitting on me. Good luck!",
