            "body": "So I have a Winners aka TJX store aka TJMaxx depending where you're from. I go into their natural section and try new smaller (usually made in my country) brands. \n\nThe current one I am in love with is Botanical Wonder Lavender and Rose Oil Suger Scrub, it leaves my body feeling super smooth and refreshed. It helps get rid of the bumps underneath my thighs and on my arms. I always use it before I shave, it takes off all the dead skin and thins the hair a bit for a better shave. \n\nIve always had acne prone skin, if tried a lot of brands to help my skin out and Dermalogica was the one brand that didn't make my skin feel oily/dry/gross/unclean. Their moisturizer makes my skin super soft and as actually moisturizes! I also began using their face scrub with just cleans my fave so well and since using the products my face has cleared up a lot and during my periods my acne is a lot better that what it would be. \n\nI swear by bath salts! So all consist of Epsom salts which when dissolved break down into magnesium and sulfate this means it can get into your body and help relax muscles and loosen stiff joints (my give my body a little extra rub to help). You can get many different ones, once again I hit up the natural section and get the best bang for your buck (price for size when finding something new) which is Hello Botanical. They have many different combinations that include lavender, sage, orange, coconut, rose... The list goes on. Each main ingredient (like ones listed) have different aromas and reasons for the combo which says on the bag. I usually get anything with lavender because I love it, currently i have lavender and sage which is very relaxing and tranquil, beautiful for an evening.\n\nSo when I used Bio-Oil it was more for after the shower (about every 2 maybe 3 days), moist my body up and header out or to sleep. I saw results after the first 2 weeks of using it. Now depending how apparent the stretch marks/scars are it will dial down the visibility of them. For scars (mine are mainly shaving scars on my legs lol) it will (for me at least) get rid of them. For my stretch marks, they are definitely still their but mine used to be dark but now they are lighter and less harsh, it smoothed my skin while evening out my skin tone.",

            "body": "Looking \"expensive\" has to do with grooming than anything. The nails and nail beds should always be kept neat and clean. Teeth should always be brushed and plaque tartar-free. \n\nI've noticed a lot of people don't really understand what old money really looks like. Allow me to provide some insight since I now have access to that world (I didn't previously). They literally do not care what you look like. I've been at the country club and men and women are running around with bad breath, terrible hair, etc. They ALL know the other is rich (otherwise they don't have access to the cc), there's no need to keep up appearances. A lot of the women just age and do so happily. There's not always a need for plastic surgery or intense makeup unless it's a DIRECT reflection of how the woman wants to present herself. I only find that \"working women\" with careers like myself tend to emphasize physical appearance and skincare. \n\nOne of the most successful Chinese women I know (shops CASUALLY at Harry Winston, Cartier, etc) and is in her 60s. She always just wears a little graphic tee and leggings and slippers because she's comfortable in it. Her whole outfit probably costs less than $70 overall. She only does her brow makeup and leaves the rest of her face bare. Her hair is thin and thrown into a ponytail/bun. But she always looks clean, moisturized, and healthy. The only giveaway TO ME that she's rich? I went to her house and she let me play with her jewelry and perfume. I would have never known. She drives a Prius or just Ubers when she's not in the mood to drive. \n\nWe only met because she came into my place of work to buy something. (Our clientele is NOT rich people). No one spoke Chinese but me and I came out to do basic translation for her. We spent a half hour touring the store, getting to know each other. We gossiped, chatted, I got her water. I spent about 4 months cultivating this relationship with her. When she'd come in,   \nI'd say hello and always go out of my way to help her. Eventually, she asks if I wanted to come to her house sometime to try her cooking. \n\nBe careful about how you judge others and yourself for not looking \"expensive\". Odds are, the real ones don't care and neither should you (to an extent).",

            "body": "Hello! Just a few ideas for you:\n\n- For just 2 eyeshadows you can get a really nice look. Get a shimmery light shade that's just a bit lighter than your skin colour and pat it all over your eyelid with a flat eyeshadow brush. Then take a darker matte colour and add it to the outer corner of your eye with a fluffy blending brush. Start on the outside and blend it inwards to add a nice contour to your eye.\n- if you want to make your eyes look larger, use a white eyeliner pencil or highlighter on the inner corner of your eye, and the pencil on your lower waterline.\n- add a bit of mascara and eyeliner if you want, it's a pretty neutral look so any bold lip will look good!\n- if you want to make Hazel eyes pop, add a little bit of gold eyeshadow under your eye or instead of the lid colour, it really brings out the tones in your eye colour!\n\nI really hope this is useful to you!\n\nxx",

Something that I would do to help advance my skills a bit is mimicking the techniques used in a lot of beauty videos and searching up advice (such as what lip color better suits my skin tone). I feel like the more research that you do, and the more practice that you have with products the better you'll become. With that said, try buying a specific product, or see how other people use the products you already have. For example, maybe you have a colourpop lippie stick, see what other people say by looking it up, looking at photos that are in the description, etc.! Good luck! :)",

Shipping took about a week so it just wouldn't be great for a last minute purchase.\n\nI've also used rent the runway and absolutely love the quality (although I will say they haven't done a great job of keeping up with trends). A similar service I've seen on Instagram is fashion pass that has some trendier/sexier items. \n\nIf you want to spend a little more on a dress you'll wear again, Revolve and Reformation are good choices but you're paying for really nice quality. That said, you can typically resell them on Poshmark or something for the same approximate value once you're done with it.",

            "body": "Hello!! I\u2019m not the most fashionable person, but I can give you some skin care advice. My first tip would be too avoid \u201cnatural remedies\u201d like the plague. Anything like rubbing lemon juice or baking soda on your face is a big mistake. I did this at your age, and it created many more problems than it cured. \n\nI don\u2019t know how severe your acne is, but going to a drugstore and getting a Cetaphil facewash, a Neutrogena moisturizer, Neutrogena spot treatment, and a sunscreen (any brand is fine, just look for a label that says \u201cnon comedogenic\u201d which means it doesn\u2019t clog pores. Neutrogena makes a lot of great ones!) is a great start. If your acne is on the more severe side, like 10- 20 plus zits at the same time, you may want to ask your parent if they can take you to a dermatologist. Oftentimes dermatologists can prescribe a cream or gel that is much more effective at treating acne than an drugstore cream. \n\nIf your parent can\u2019t or won\u2019t take you to a derm, then your best bet is a drugstore cream called \u201cDifferin\u201d. It is a little more expensive, I want to say 20 dollars a tube? But it last for months and you only need a very small amount at night. If you choose to start using differin, you MUST wear sunscreen during the day. Differin is awesome at clearing up acne, but it does make your skin more sensitive to the sun. So thats kind of the trade off there! \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned the skincare addiction sub is great, but I think the amount of info there can be a bit overwhelming for a newbie. But if you have more specific questions thats a great place to go. \n\nLastly, I just want to say, don\u2019t stress to much about acne or beauty. Everyone else will be in the same boat as you worrying about that kind of stuff. High school is a stressful time in everyone\u2019s life, but you should enjoy the ride and try your best to take care of yourself too! I wish you the very best of luck :)",

From what I gather, use a LOT of gel to create a cast over your wet curl pattern so it keeps a hold when dry and doesn\u2019t frizz up. Like I mean a lot, half a palmful for each half. Depending on what type of gel you use though. Also, everyone is different. Some people\u2019s hair likes more moisture vs more protein depending on porosity but also just genetics.",
