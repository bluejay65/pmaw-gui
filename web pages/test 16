Theres a high probability if its continuous and all over this is actually keratosis pilaris (like you might get on your upper arms) which is a dry skin condition irritated by physical exfoliation. I recommend switching to a gentle BHA of SA cleanser as an exfoliator and moisturizing daily. Its exacerbated by friction -- do you notice it looks better when wearing cotton all day/worse when wearing scratchy jeans? I recommend a full coverage cotton brief to protect your skin while you figure out whats going on! If that doesnt work, it can also be treated very effectively with medications like accutane. see a derm!",

            "body": "Hello! For nails, I really love Essie and OPI polishes. Invest in a strengthening base coat (I like OPI\u2019s). I would also recommend moisturizing your hands often.  As far as makeup: I\u2019m a big fan of Urban Decay but if you\u2019re looking for something less pricy, color pop offers some very pigmented products with low costs. Find a shampoo and conditioner that work well with your hair type and don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different washing intervals - some people need to wash more, some need to wash less. Do not cut your own shag, you\u2019ll wind up with a mullet. Other tips: find a mascara you really like. Some days, just using mascara, eyeliner, a little lipgloss, and a pinch of the cheeks really livens up my look. Invest in a good hairbrush (wet brush) and a detangljng spray. I also like running a little argan oil through my hair when it\u2019s damp - especially before I blow it out.",

            "body": "Hello fellow late-to-the-feminine-game lady!\n\n\nNails: Invest in a good quality clear top coat. Even crappy polish can work for you with the right topper. Also grab a decent \"nude\" shade. Something like a beige or soft pink that you could wear to a formal event. Otherwise, grab yourself some brights and rainbows for fun. My holy grail brand is Holo Taco; it's woman owned and specializes in bold, unusual finishes like iridescent flakes and holographic glitters. The brand owner also has a youtube channel, SimplyNailogical, where she has made several videos on how to care for and strengthen your natural nails!\n\n\nHair: Is your hair textured/frizzy? If so, I highly recommend the curlyhair subreddit. There is an FAQ there that walks through all of the hair things, including porosity, hair structure, protein, the difference between hydration and moisture, etc. Even if your natural hair is stick straight (though that's very rare) you can still learn a lot about which oils/butters will best suit your hair needs! Once you have narrowed down what your hair needs help with, you can ask for specific product recommendations!\n\n\nSkin: While you didn't explicitly mention it, a fantastic form of self care (especially if you've never tried it out) is skincare. The skincareaddiction subreddit is a great place to ask for skin specific advice! There is also a youtube channel called Hyram that has a Skincare 101 series. It will walk you through the basic steps of a full routine so that you have some running knowledge!\n\n\nMakeup: The basics that you'll want on hand are a concealer, a mascara, and a neutral/nude lip color. Those three will do a lot of work for you from day one! (Specific product recs will depend on your location and skintone, but this sub is a great place to ask for suggestions!) If you're new to eyeshadow, Colourpop has a wide array of small palettes that fill a color story. I bet you can find one that hits all of your current goals! As for eyeshadow brushes, RealTechniques has some inexpensive brushes in a set to start out with!\n\n\nMy personal favorite product: SheaMoisture has several deep conditioning hair masques that make my hair *so* happy. Especially coming out of America's winter, it has been a lifesaver for keeping my hair soft and untangled!",
