If I did it for my thirtieth I'd...\n\nHighlights and hair a few days before\n\nSpray tan after months of using my Salux regularly (I get mine from Amazon) and a manual scrub once a week. I got a spray tan in 2003, but they were new and mine was orange! Ugh! Also moisturizing with Bio Oil for scars and it really cuts the dryness and invest in a good body cream. \n\nSkincare! Exfoliation with AHA and my Amour Pacific enzymes. Tons of moisture with German Nivea. Retinol. Argireline. Water (but I drink over a gallon per day anyway), masks...sheet and my Hello Honey! strawberry honey mask for moisture. A week before, a professional facial. I don't think I need acid resurfacing as my skin is actually pretty good for 45. My skin is sensitive, I try not to overdo. \n\nNails! I'd get pink gels. Before I just got a manicure on natural nails, Jewel of India OPI. I'd get them a few days before, not same day! It was Black Friday, too crowded! Anxiety inducing. Pedicure, last time I got my favorite pedicure shade, Pompeii Purple, OPI. Before I'd massage Bio Oil in my hands everyday, a few times a day, I call it my youth serum, lol. \n\nDiet and exercise is definitely most important. I was on Lexapro in 2003, a medication I definitely shouldn't be on. I got a DNA medication test in 18\" and Lexapro came up as incompatible. I gained 30 pounds and first time in my life (i was 29) was over 125. I'd consume less carbs (I'm type one diabetic anyway) and exercise five days a week, weight training and cardio. Yoga for relaxation. \n\nI'd do my makeup myself,  like I did for my wedding. Just lots of trial and error from YouTube tutorials. I did lashes for my reunion, maybe again, but practice more this time? I'm really bad at lashes despite lots of tutorials. \n\nOutfit, really, really good undergarments. I bought a full length Spanx type corset thing from Bloomingdales before my tenth reunion and it was horribly uncomfortable! Maybe I'd invest in SKims?",

            "body": "MY TIME TO SHINE! Hello, I am a cosmetic chemist. I work alongside a much older formulator than myself, he developed many many many patents in skincare, hair care, etc. One specific line he worked on was Olay. Olay is one of the only, if not the only, skincare brand that has real clinical results on their packaging that are 100% honest. Olay is in the same price range as Loreal, so this would be another great line to look into. So here's the cosmetic chemist mumbo jumbo. It's all the same, my friend. Okay maybe this skin cream has a fancy extract in it that \"helps\", or this one is vegan, yada yada yada. Moisturizers are generally all the same: put some glycerin, some CCT, some emollients, water, a preservative, and there you have it... a moisturizer. The best benefit would be to choose one with sunscreen if you are not already using a sunscreen. Different ethnicities start aging at different times, for example, I'm Caucasian and biologically start showing signs of aging at a whopping 16 years old, RIP to my skin. \n\nYour best benefits will be to moisturize, use a sunscreen, use an eye cream (a preventative will be the best), and always clean your face. There's of course wrinkle repair and all of that. But until you are to the point of needing that, what I have listed will be your best preventatives for early aging.",

The price is annoying ($38) but I love a good lip tint, and the color and consistency are just perfect on every shade. I don't even care about the \"clean beauty\" aspect of it, the way it wears is smooth and buttery. Other gloss tints are too sticky for me.",

No more ingrowns, no more re-growth (whatever hairs I have left are sparse and extremely fine) and hello super-smooth skin! \n\nYes, it\u2019s expensive, but such a worthwhile investment and when you compare the cost to a lifetime of razor blades, shaving creams, exfoliatiors etc, it pales into comparison!\n\nHonestly, it feels so liberating not to have to worry about wearing an outfit that shows my arms or legs and my showers only take me about 5-10 minutes on average. It\u2019s freed up a lot of my time which is a terrific bonus.",

I\u2019ve heard it many many times and I too get frustrated sometimes.\n\nWhat type of hairstyle are you looking for? You said your hair is straight? Have you checked out the instyler tool? \n\nFor skincare definitely make sure to use a proper cleanser not just a body wash. Remember to moisturize and if your concern is the occasional pimple then I\u2019d recommend a spot treatment.\nMy favorite regimen to follow was banish skincare. Check them out for sure, their spot treatment, pumpkin mask &amp; clay mask worked amazing for me. Omg I almost forgot their vitamin c must was amazing too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nMakeup is such a broad topic...you can always head to a Mac or sephora to get a foundation match. \nBrows have changed over the years so filling them in is a a must for me who has over tweezed in the past.\nThis response was pretty long but I tried to get straight to the point lol, I hope it helped and I\u2019m definitely here still if you want more advice/help with makeup \ud83d\ude0a",

It makes me feel SO much better and is so worth the price to me.\n\nI sometimes drop into the benefit brow bar at ulta if my home waxing for my brows gets a little out of shape... then i'll  grow mine out and go in. so that's probably maybe 3 or 4 times a year max.

Here are a few points on how to choose your toothpaste for pimple treatment:   \n\n\n1.  White Toothpaste.\n2. Avoid teeth-whitening toothpaste.\n3. No Gel or Fluoride kinds of toothpaste\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsage:\n\n1. wash your face\n2. Apply only on the pimple, not on surrounding skin.\n3. Keep it for 2 hours or overnight. \n4. wash it gently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToothpaste cannot be treated as a medicine, but it surely reduces the pimple size. It may cause irritation and inflammation, hence do not use it more than 4 times a week.\u00a0After applying toothpaste on pimple once a day, for 2-3 days in a row, you might notice an improvement in the size and color of the pimple. After which it is advisable to allow the pimple to heal on its own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.\n\nJahnavi",

            "body": "Hello.   \n\n\nAcne takes time to go. You are doing great. **Try some benzoyl peroxide** \u2013\u00a0Like salicylic acid**,** Benzoyl peroxide is used to kill the bacteria that contribute to acne. Benzoyl peroxide comes in different concentrations, but benzoyl peroxide with a 2.5% concentration is just as effective as 5-10% solutions, and it\u2019s less irritating to the skin to boot. Benzoyl peroxide also helps peel away layers of dead skin, leaving brighter, more rejuvenated, including clear skin in its place.  \n\n\nHere are some of the general tips to help you with your acne. I hope it helps!  \n\n\n1. **Don\u2019t touch your pimple.**  \nMost people who have acne, have the habit to pop it. It is a big NO. Never pop your pimple, they have bacterias in them, bursting them will only spread them and infect other areas. Don\u2019t touch your face because it contains dirt and oil so constantly rubbing or touching your face and the affected area will cause inflammation, redness, and pain.\n2. **Keep it simple.**  \nTry to avoid makeup, applying foundation and powder on the affected area will make the acne worse. Oily products will clog the skin pores and worse the situation. Wash your face before sleeping, don\u2019t rub or use harsh soap again your skin, keep it simple, this also removes excessive oil. This will help remove dead skin cells, dust, and impurities and give\u00a0a clear skin.\n3. **Drink more water.**  \nKeep yourself hydrated by drinking 9-12 glasses of water in a day. Skin like other organs of the body like kidney also needs enough water for hydration. Staying hydrated will bring the glow to your face and drinking water will clean your system and detox your face.\n4. **Sugar is bad.**  \nAvoid sugary drinks \u2013 soda, juices, sweeteners \u2013 cake, chocolates, ice creams from your diet. This high calories food increases insulin which triggers pimple hormones. Hence don\u2019t take sugary food.\n5. **Eat a balanced diet, healthy food.**  \nAvoid junk foods \u2013 oily and high calories food increases acne breakouts. And drink less milk \u2013 milk has acne-producing agents, especially in men. Eat more vegetables, fruit, and green tea. Antioxidants, help in skincare, takes care of anti-aging.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.\n\nJahnavi",

            "body": "Hello! Hairstylist here! \n\nThe natural hair spectrum ranges from level one (black) to level ten (very light blonde). In your picture it looks to be about a level 4ish. When colouring the hair if you\u2019re looking to deposit colour and depending on whether you\u2019re going lighter or darker that will determine whether there is lifting involved. (\u201cLifting\u201d referring to lifting the \u201clevel\u201d of the hair from one level to another. AKA lightening). Because your natural hair colour is black any colour you dye your hair, aside from black, will always involve some kind of lightening aspect to it. Ultimately, the amount of lift depends on how light you wish to go. From level one to level four, you\u2019re looking at 3 levels of lift, which can be achieved through use of colour and 9% peroxide rather then through use of bleach.  However, you could also use bleach with a lower volume of peroxide. It\u2019s a grey area, the route and method and best course of action would be determined by your stylist after a consultation. \n\nWhen used correctly by an educated stylist bleach and lightening is not as scary as the reputation it has. Modern day colouring technology allows us to use the most gentle and effective formulas then ever before! Bleach gets a bad rap because of bleach fails by people who have no idea what they\u2019re doing lol. \n\nIt\u2019s great you\u2019re planning on going to a stylist! There\u2019s a lot to consider when looking at a clients hair and determining the best course of action. Like I said, bleach gets a bad rap. Don\u2019t be afraid of lightening, it\u2019s really not that scary in the hands of a trusted professional :-). \n\nHope this helps!",

Higher heat settings are better for resistant hair, but be careful. Once you've dropped the new curl, twist it around your finger and hold the strand until it's cooled. You can speed up the cooling using a blowdyer on a cold setting if you wish. Once the curl is cooled, let it fall and apply your hairspray (make sure the spray is STRONG hold!) By individually spraying each curl once it's finished cooling, you will ensure a better hold throughout the day. When you heat up hair, you are changing the bonds within the hairstrand and they remain easily changeable while they remain heated, so by letting them cool in a tight curl unaffected by gravity they will definitely have more longevity. You can then give your finished head of curls another coat of hairspray to keep the final style in place.",

If you want to express your frustration, you can use your bot to log overused phrases and make a r//dataisbeautiful post or whatever. That way you'll reach more people and be less annoying. Please stop it. Noone likes this bot.\n\nTo the humans. Don't mind this bot. It doesn't matter what it says.

Your scalp is overcompensating for the lack of moisture in your hair, so to combat this I would recommend investing in a sulfate free, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I would also say if you dye your hair or use heat on it, invest in a hair mask and a good heat protectant!\n\nMy favorite heat protectant: Briogeo Rosarco blow dry perfection &amp; heat protectant cr\u00e8me.\n\nGood luck!",

I\u2019ll also recommend some of YSL\u2019s lips some are very sheer that I consider them lip balms!!\n\nI would even say, invest in a lip tint and put a gloss/lip balm on top to make the color stay and also give that natural look!\n\nGood luck!",

            "body": "Hello!\n\nI also suffer from extremely dry and sensitive skin! I would recommend to go through your products and see what can be thrown out! Skincare all starts with the makeup remover you use! I recommend using micellar water, it\u2019s gentle and usually doesn\u2019t have a lot of ingredients!  Try to use a very gentle cleanser such as Cetaphil! To get a deeper clean use a soft facial brush but make sure to sanitize after every use! Then and this is important: invest in a good sunblock and moisturizer!\n\nI personally recommend these moisturizers:\n\nAny moisturizer from Caudalie. (French brand)\n\nDrunk Elephant (literally their moisturizers are so good!)\n\nMy personal favorite and what I\u2019m currently using: Belief aqua bomb moisturizer\n\nI will admit, the moisturizers are pricey but well worth it! Step into Sephora and get samples, best way to see if you\u2019ll react! Good luck! ",

I do use a mattifying moisturizer with added spf so that I can multitask with as little product as possible. Then I go in with a pore filling primer (I use the tarte timeless primer but I have also liked benefit porefessional, I am also trying out the elf putty primer\u2014 no verdict on that one yet). Then, I prefer to use a lower coverage foundation or even a tinted moisturizer because you can\u2019t really tell as much when it starts to slide off your face. In the summer, I\u2019ve been known to use the benefit hello foundation and in the winter I usually go for the bare minerals complexion rescue tinted moisturizer. Similarly to you, I then use some concealer under my eyes and bring the excess to my nose, forehead and chin. I immediately set it all with a TON of banana powder. I use essence brighten up banana powder and I find it works wonders for my t zone if I bake with it \u2014 NOT if I just apply it with a powder brush. While that bakes, I put on my brows and other powder makeup (bronzer, blush, highlight and eye shadow). I will brush away excess bake and kind of push any left over powder over my face to blend everything together. I find the most important part of my routine and the part that keeps me from getting super shiny and also keeps my foundation in place is setting spray. I have been going back and forth between fix+ and TF hangover setting spray. \n\n*TL;DR Setting spray is EVERYTHING. Good luck!",

I wanna start off by saying please don\u2019t use the apricot scrub mentioned above, in aesthetics class that was our prime example of an item used that is bad for you. We studied the ingredients and the affect each has on your skin. Start with more water intake, as this will not only help your body but it will also help your skin! \n\nLook up massage techniques for under the eyes that you can use while washing your face. This will help decrease the dark circles and feel good. \n\nI have my boyfriend using First Aid Beauty from Sephora because it\u2019s an entry level price and really simple + gentle + nonscented. Use their face wash, then moisturizer once daily. Once a week use an exfoliant (chemical or manual) to help your skin\u2019s cell turnover rate. Your skin will take about 3 months to really (I mean 100%) get used to a skin care line. It may freak out in the beginning but please stick through anything you choose rather than skipping around to other things hoping for better results! ",

You wont ever completely rid yourself of them, but they will fade with time and moisturizers. I make an all natural stretch mark cream that is helping to fade my pregnancy stretch marks.

The one piece of advice that I've noticed is not talked about, is going back to your laser appointments every 2 months or 8 weeks. I believe laser places suggest 6 weeks but that amount of time does not give the hair enough time to grow back so that the laser can remove the root of the hair.  Once I started going every 8 weeks to 2 months I noticed a world of a difference. I hope this helps and good Luck :) ",

Drinking a lot of water helps me too. I rarely drink soda, and I drink alcohol in moderation as these tend to make me dehydrated.

Out of nowhere it clears up and I realized the only thing I had done differently was switching toothpastes! I guess I was allergic to some ingredient that I didn\u2019t realize and now I use Hello toothpaste and also a Toms Whole Care so the changes have been good. \n\nI know that\u2019s not a lip thing exactly but my point being, if something is bothering you and it\u2019s chronic, consider everything that comes in contact with your skin every day, not just cosmetics and skincare products, but also dish soap on your utensils, and other things in your environment.

Essentially what you need is shampoo with lots of citrus in, this is super enzymic and help strip more of the oils away! \n\nOptions from Lush:\n\nMontalbano - a solid shampoo bar, lots of citrus in here and super cleansing!\nSeanik - also a solid shampoo bar. lemon to cleanse, seaweed to soften and sea salt for a little bit of volume.\nRehab - a more traditional liquid shampoo. Kiwi and mango to cleanse the hair, with extra virgin olive oil to add some moisture back in. This option is slightly stronger than the other two, so I\u2019d be more careful with coloured hair. If you can get to to a store, ask the staff for a sample.\n\nSide note: all bar one of our shampoos contain SLS, there is nothing in this (as far as I\u2019m aware) that will be making your hair more oily. It is simply used as a foaming agent in our products.",

(The most common one being biotique lip balms and also Himalayan herbals balm. They are both Indian brands! There's mixed reviews! I haven't tried it, but some say it works!) \n\nBut my number one thing would be to put a light, natural, non petroleum/paraben lotion on your lips so that they would be hydrated enough for the skin to just flake off without a scrub or physical exfoliation. Then apply lip balm to seal the moisture.\n\nAvoid physical exfoliation because your lips would dry out and just flake more! Also, it could be out of your control! So please embrace it :)\n\nMy top lip is darker than my bottom one. I just happen to have a lipline that's naturally darker than my bottom and top lip :)) it really doesn't look bad and you'd be surprised that some people admire your lips!\n",

You don't want to look older or too young.  \nI like the idea of a shorter hair cut and going a little darker for your hair color.  I am also blond and my hair dresser basically never does low lights for me since my hair comes in as a pretty dark (and boring) blond these days.  I am caucasion, blond hair, green eyes, 5'4\" for reference.  Women's size 8 or 10 (US).\nAs far as dress, skinny jeans are awesome because you can wear a boot, a heel, a flat, a sneaker, etc.  and you don't have to worry about your pants dragging on the ground!  They also make your legs look shapely.  \nI really don't wear that much in the way of make-up.  I am an eye make-up girl - eye shadow primer, eye shadow, eye liner, and then I will curl my eyelashes with a Tarte eyelash curler (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and then I will apply mascara.  Serum and moisturizer is all I wear on my skin.  No foundation for me.  Lip gloss I buy but rarely wear. \n LOL  I find it annoying, so I tend to wear coco butter lip balm most days!  I like to \"play\" with different shades of eye shadow for a more youthful look and feel.  I have green eyes and today happens to be a bolder looking purple, with black liner and mascara.  :-)  The rest of my look is muted today - black cardigan with white stripes and long gray bootleg work trousers.  Black boots.\nBased on how your skin looks in your pics, I am thinking you have a good beauty routine and you swear by night creams and moisturizers.  Highly recommend that for keeping up with the aging process.  \nI like to find a small thing to work with as far as a look to feel and look more youthful.  Today it is my eye shadow.  Other days I will wear a scarf around my neck, a statement necklace that is more bold, a top with ruffled sleeves, a pair of red shoes, leopard print flats, a fun handbag, etc.  \nI try not to go overboard because I don't want to look forced or out of place like you mentioned.  I love fashion and style and all that comes with it and I have had people tell me they like what I am wearing.  I say have fun!  \nMy two cents...  Good luck!  You are awesome!  :-)  \nEdited for spelling!",

Here is what is helping me ATM:\n\n\nCurrently I do prescription strength retin-a (stieva-a) before I sleep, on my face and retinol in squalane oil in alternating strengths (1% sometimes 0.2%) -to minimize irritation- on my neck and shoulders area. During the day I do an antioxidant from The Ordinary on my face (resveratrol 3% + ferulic acid 3%- as my skin found the 20% vitamin c broke me out in crazy irritation rash, it's just too strong for my tretinoin affected skin, so I've kept it in the fridge hopefully to be utilized \"someday\") and a lotion containing a high amount of niacinamide on my neck and shoulders area during the day, I use \"scinic honey all in one ampule\"\n\nAlso the sunscreen I use during any time outside is called \"propaira\" spf 50 very high protection sunscreen\" and it has niacinamide in it and I think, is a chemical sunscreen. It's the first sunscreen I've found that melts into my skin like butter and isn't like trying to smooth pva glue into my skin, which is amazing to me, so I keep using it even though I have hesitations due to it NOT having either zinc oxide or titanium oxide included  on the ingredients list. \n\nHope this helps, this is basically like triage for my skin! Everyone I know now thinks I'm batshit insane because I've become obsessed with skincare + active ingredients + giant hats ... But it works for me and I'm trying to undo years of stupid thoughtless damage so.... Yeah.\n\nPrices: Prescription retin-a = $27-32\n              Retinol in squalane = $ 12.70\n              T.o antioxidant = $13.90\n               Scinic honey a.i.o = $20\n               Pro Paira spf 50 = $20-30 ",

For instance, you can drink more water, avoid the sun, adopt a diet that is lower in saturated fat and in its glycemic(sugary) index. It is not as probable that it will make you \"beautiful\". Please do not fall for the stereotype presented in movies like \"The Princess Diaries\". That should be interpreted as fantasy instead of reality. Physical beauty also comprises of  defined bone structure and a shapely body type. While you could use heavy makeup and a lot of undergarments, and plastic surgery to imitate that, I know that is not what you want to do. Frankly, I do not support such means either.\n\nIn conclusion, be the very best version of yourself( I know, I used a clich\u00e9). What are attainable ways that you can change your appearance? What aspects of your appearance do you want to change, that can realistically be changed? Please consider this.\n\nHave a wonderful day jouney2 freedom!

            "body": "Hello!! I have long, wavy, frizzy hair too and have had it my whole life. My hair is down to my waist.  Wavy or curly hair is more prone to frizz than straight hair because the strands lack hydration. So the trick to getting rid of it is to keep your hair moisturized. Personally, I use a hair mask to help with this. I have two that I use, one is one that I purchase and the other is DIY. It has coconut milk, avocado, and extra virgin olive oil. Coconut milk is why this homemade hair mask is so good for the hair! The high amount of natural fats, proteins and vitamins is what really helps nourish the hair with what it needs. Plus, if your looking for a natural de-tangler, have hair thinning or want to increase your hair growth coconut milk is great for this! Avocado on the other hand is responsible for making the hair soft, silky and frizz free! And extra virgin olive oil is amazing for keeping the scalp moist (if you experience dandruff or dry scalp). I was seriously BLOWN AWAY at how soft, shiny and frizz free it left my hair. I would recommend to start off with finding a hair mask and applying it once a week for 10-15 mins (before on dry hair, or after you shower on wet hair). You should begin to notice a difference in your hair right away. Use a hair mask twice a week MAX over moisturizing you hair can cause strange things to happen like you hair falling out. I hope you find this helpful and let me know if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help in any way I can :)",

Then, use as much as foundation your face needs. Not too much, not less than needed. After that, try setting it with powder, and brush away the excess powder on your face. Pat your face with your hand to feel if there's any greasiness from the make up. Also, hair is very important, if you don't want to sweat a lot, try pulling them in a very high ponytail if you have long hair. Drink lots of water, and have some tissues with you, so you can pat your face lightly to take away the sweat. \n\nIf you can, have a compact powder with a tiny mirror in it, in your purse, and apply some when needed. I hope it helped, have a nice day! ",

Say hello to sexy soft lips after using our product. Babassu has a tendency to try to solidify depending on temperature so if that happens just make sure to rub bottle between hands until lip oil is warm. Jojoba oil is a big bonus because it contains a lot of vitamins and minerals. Vitamin E helps to sooth and prevent chapped skin.

I love all things hair and makeup related and I also went to cosmetology school so I'm gonna try to answer your questions as best as possible! \n-For your mani-pedi, based on where you live will determine  the price. It will probably range from about $20-$40 but it's definitely worth it. The nail technician will be able to tell you how soon you should come in for maintenance but it will probably only be about once a month. \n-For your hair, I highly recommend going into your local beauty supply store and getting a deep conditioner and doing it once a week. It will help repair the damage that the bleach and your dye have caused. I would also recommend using a vegan semi permanent dye such as Manic Panic or Artic Fox. They're both inexpensive and super conditioning to your hair! If you're going for a silvery blue color, get a dark blue dye and dilute it with a white conditioner and your color will last for a longggggg time. I do this (except with purple dye) to tone my blonde hair! \n-For your skin, I recommend getting African black soap. I, like you, have pale acne prone red skin. This little bar of soap has COMPLETELY changed my skin. It's evened out my tone and I've stopped breaking out. I use the Shea Moisture brand that I got at Target for like $3. I wash once in the morning and once at night with it and put on moisturizer afterwards. But when I do find myself getting red or having a breakout, I use my green color correcting cream. Mine is by the brand NYX  and it's amazing. I let my brother use it for picture day on his breakouts and it took away all of the redness. \nI hope this helps \ud83d\ude0a",

Shampoo hair 2x each time you shower and try to rinse until water runs clear. Also, apply conditioner to your entire hair and let it set for 3-5 minutes (this will seal the cuticle of your hair). I hope that comes out for you soon!",

Many of them will have similar options, like wrinkles, skin tightening, skin conditions, and so on, but there are a lot more than BOTOX. Like others have mentioned, you could do a cream, dermabrasion, etc. \n\n\nOnce you have made a list of all the procedures that *could* work, vet them against what the community at [RealSelf](http://www.realself.com/reviews). While RS is known for plastic surgery it is also a great resource for all things cosmetic. Look for the worth it rating for the specific procedures you're considering and read some of the stories. On the left of each review you will either see a positive, neutral or negative rating. I would suggest looking at a lot of these.  \n\n\nLastly, for all that is holy in this world, please don't go to some cheap place that has no reputation in your market. Go to someone who is hopefully board-certified in Dermatology **and** with positive reviews at Google, Yelp, RateMDs, Vitals, etc.\n\n\nUnfortunately, none of us are in a position to directly suggest an remedy for you, without seeing it like a pro will during a consultation. Good luck to you!! :)\n\n\nEDIT: Obviously try water and other simple solutions first, but you seem to be interested in procedures, so I wanted to coach you on that journey if you go that route. ",

I've used really expensive conditioner in the past (like Matrix Biolage) but this works better than anything else I've tried.  My hair is super hydrated without being weighed down when I use it.  Plus it's super cheap, so if it doesn't work for you, you aren't out much.  It does have cones in it, so if your hair doesn't respond well to them, just be aware.",

It's been something I've battled for years, unsuccessfully. \n\nThen, one day, I did a before and after over at /r/makeupaddiction. The advice I got was invaluable. Someone posted [THIS tutorial](http://imgur.com/a/5T9Z5) using Mabelline Dream Touch Lumi Pen.  Unfortunately I don't have any before or after photos because I have a bit of a skin problem at the moment. But I use the Radiant version religiously now.\n\nOn especially bad days, I have been using e.l.f. highlighter underneath of this, just in the inner corner where the pigmentation is the worst. I make sure to blend it well with a beauty blender or clean sponge applicator. Since I started doing this, I've gotten a lot of compliments about how \"fresh\" and \"young\" I look. So it's worked really well for me. \n\nThen of course there's all the standard advice: drink lots of water, get adequate rest, make sure you're getting enough nutrients and vitamins. If you want more information about how to minimize those dark circles and bags without the use of makeup. I found [this article](http://altmedicine.about.com/od/drcathywongsanswers/f/darkcircleseyes.htm) pretty useful. \n\nGood luck!",

I have been in search for the \"perfect\" solution for my under-eye issues, alas nothing has been perfect but I've found some good solutions.  [Here's me](http://imgur.com/7Sbk1eH) without makeup (pay no mind to the cat on my back).  No matter what I do I always have dark bags under my eyes and regardless of what I do, I always have creases under my eyes.  What I've found to be helpful is to make sure it's well moisturized (I just use jergens lotion) and a primer (smashbox photo finish).  Then I use a slightly oily product that stays moist/doesn't completely dry. This way it kind of \"floats\" on the skin and can be spread back around throughout the day without caking or being rubbed off (because it will invariably settle into the creases regardless of the product).  \n\nSo far I've found MAC PRO Longwear concealer, Make-Up Forever concealer palette, Christian Dior NudeSkin concealer, and NARS Radiant Concealer as the best formulas for our unique needs. I am currently using NARS and I'm quite pleased. \n\nLastly, Do Not put powder under your eyes, the key is to keep it as moisturized as possible, dryness is the enemy. \n\nLast, last tip: when applying the concealer, be sure to check your application from different angles -- side to side, tilt your head forward/tuck your chin,  lift your chin,  all combos of those, that way you don't miss a spot or over-apply in areas. \n\nEdit: Crap,  forgot to include [me with makeup](http://imgur.com/Dhse20m)   just keep in mind that I applied that at 6 am and it is currently 4:30 PM.

I have even given it to my animal companions for a healthy coat and it worked wonders. You can put actual flax seed oil in your salad dressing, you can take ground flax seeds and put them in a smoothie, but the easiest thing is to take capsules and you can get them from any pharmacy store, Trader Joe's (they have reasonably priced vitamins), and even the grocery store. \n\nAs for your hair, pulling it up is probably has something to do with it falling out. The elastic band might be adding to the amount of hair that is coming out, do you notice hair around the elastic band or if you take the band out, do you notice hair coming out then? Try wearing it down one extra day a week. Do you sleep with it tied up? Try not doing that. \n\nAs for shampoo and conditioners. I would try something more natural. A salon brand is going to be best- Aveda makes a great plant based product, Purology is my favourite and is all plant based, abba, but if you are on a budget and really can't spend $20/bottle then I would give the new Herbal Essences a try. Hello Hydration is good, I have even tried it on a trip. I really do recommend trying Aveda or Purology. If you find an Aveda salon they have travel sizes that you can buy and try before really investing. Also, really do try the flax supplement. It does wonders. I have had the same problem :) ",

            "body": "Hey! So I don't know what your hair/skin texture is, but I've got curly hair (tight wave/loose curls; I'm Indian, so my hair texture is somewhere in between Caucasian and Asian) and combination skin, so this is what I do every day (sorry for the wall of text) : \n\n**MORNING**\n\n*I have curly hair, so I don't shampoo every day. I do, however, wet my hair in the shower and scrub with conditioner (Right now I'm using Trader Joe's brand moisturizing conditioner, but I have also used Pantene, Herbal Essences Hello Hydration, and Aussie Moisturizing and like them all). Every 2-3 days, I shampoo. Right now I'm using Herbal Essences Hello Hydration shampoo. It's alright (I'm poor, so this is the best choice for what I'm willing to spend) \n\n\n*Soap: I use a Dove body bar for my body, and Clean and Clear Morning Burst face wash for my face. \n\n\n*Post-shower: I towel dry my hair, and while it's still wet, I apply a couple of drops of Paul Mitchell smoothing serum, and spray on One n' Only Argan Oil (which can be found at Sally's beauty supply). After putting these products in my hair, I comb my hair with a wide-tooth comb to set my part and evenly distribute the products, and then shake my head to un-clump my hair and allow to air dry. This method gives me pretty low frizz and nice curls that stay tame all day. \n\n\n*Teeth: I use Tom's of Maine toothpaste in peppermint, brush for three minutes, and use a tongue scraper to get all the nasties off my tongue. It does wonders for one's breath. \n\n\n*Pitsies: I use Secret \"Oh so very Summerberry\" deodorant. I don't know how much it keeps me from sweating, but my pits do smell awesome throughout the day. \n\n\n*Body moisture, etc.: I only moisturize my body in the wintertime, since it's the only time my skin makes me feel uncomfortable. I use Palmer's Cocoa Butter to moisturize. It's pretty thick, and it's the only product that can fix scaly knees and elbows for me. \n\n\n*Face moisture: Every day, without fail, I use Fair n'Lovely (an Indian product, can be found at most Indian supermarkets) face moisturizer. It's supposed to lighten your skin tone, but I don't think it actually does that- however, it does have SPF 15 and Vitamin E, so it does a pretty good job at moisturizing my face. \n\n\n*Makeup: I don't wear makeup every day, but when I do, I use Maybelline Beauty Balm (over my moisturizer), and Mary Kay loose powder to set it. For my eyes, I use Sephora brand Eye Primer, a Maybelline eye shadow palette, Sephora brand liquid eyeliner in Black, and CoverGirl EyeLights brand mascara, in the shade for Hazel colored eyes (my eyes hover between light brown and hazel, so I like to play up the hazel tones. The mascara is basically black with little gold flecks in it). \n\n\n*Lips: I usually just use Eos lip balm in their Mint flavor, but if I want lipstick I'll use a CoverGirl lip stain with some lip balm over it. If I'm feeling really fancy, I use Burt's Bees tinted lip balm. \n\nMy whole routine (Including makeup, showering, getting dressed, eating breakfast, everything) takes me about one hour. When I was first learning how to use liquid eyeliner it took longer, but now it's second nature to me so i can go really fast. \n\n\n**NIGHT**\n\n*Remove eye make-up with Sephora brand eye make-up remover. \n\n*Remove face make-up with Pond's Cold Cream\n*Wash face with Dove Beauty Bar\n\n*Brush teeth with Tom's of Maine toothpaste\n\n*Floss with Crest Glide floss\n\n*Scrape tongue again\n\n*Moisturize face, hands, elbows, and knees with Palmer's Cocoa Butter\n\n*ONLY if I am using shampoo the next day, put Parachute brand coconut oil in hair (can be found at most Indian supermarkets)\n\n*Drink about a liter of water\n\n*Get a full night's sleep!\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text! I don't actually do that much beauty-related stuff, but everything I've said here has contributed to keeping my hair and skin pretty healthy. Good luck!\n",

I've tried many store bought ones as well as homemade ones. I usually make my own at home and recently made this simple one and found it to be lovely for my skin. Its not one of those masks that take away all the nasty stuff trapped in your pores, its more of a mask that puts in good stuff. I have very pale skin but find that this just brightens my face up and keeps it from looking dull.\n\nDo any of you have experience with using pomegranate and/or honey?",
