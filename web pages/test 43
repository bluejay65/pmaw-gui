I\u2019ve heard it many many times and I too get frustrated sometimes.\n\nWhat type of hairstyle are you looking for? You said your hair is straight? Have you checked out the instyler tool? \n\nFor skincare definitely make sure to use a proper cleanser not just a body wash. Remember to moisturize and if your concern is the occasional pimple then I\u2019d recommend a spot treatment.\nMy favorite regimen to follow was banish skincare. Check them out for sure, their spot treatment, pumpkin mask &amp; clay mask worked amazing for me. Omg I almost forgot their vitamin c must was amazing too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nMakeup is such a broad topic...you can always head to a Mac or sephora to get a foundation match. \nBrows have changed over the years so filling them in is a a must for me who has over tweezed in the past.\nThis response was pretty long but I tried to get straight to the point lol, I hope it helped and I\u2019m definitely here still if you want more advice/help with makeup \ud83d\ude0a",

I tried many times getting highlights and stuff at different salons but I have naturally black hair and it just always turned out horrible so I gave up hair coloring and just went natural.\n\nI do my own gel nails at home, toes (non gel), eyebrow waxing, armpit waxing (hello this is awesome and super easy everyone needs to do this!!), facials with masks etc, hair conditioning treatments, self tanning, and always do my own hair &amp; makeup\n\nI don't know if this counts as beauty but I try to treat myself to a 60-90 min massage once a month or every other month. It makes me feel SO much better and is so worth the price to me.\n\nI sometimes drop into the benefit brow bar at ulta if my home waxing for my brows gets a little out of shape... then i'll  grow mine out and go in. so that's probably maybe 3 or 4 times a year max. BUT that catch with this is there is only one gal working there I trust and I will ONLY go to her lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I should note though, that I started doing all this stuff at home AFTER going to a professional salon first. I started watching them or learning from them and eventually when I knew what I wanted I began doing it myself!",
