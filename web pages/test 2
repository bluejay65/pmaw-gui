First of all I bet you are very pretty but your insecurities could be pushing people away. Do you smile and let people know that you\u2019re interested in them?

I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s changed during these last two years. I\u2019m tired of feeling afraid and seek out happy, cheerful people. Be that cheerful girl and you will draw people to you. I guarantee you\u2019re going to feel beautiful and be beautiful! The world can be a lonely place and there are a lot of lonely people who would love one of your smiles and a hello from you! The pandemic has taken one of my happiness-inducing activities (volunteer work). I\u2019m waiting for that to be possible again.

So when it blows in the wind it\u2019s not a graceful moment \ud83e\udd23 but in 2012 I cut my hair into a bob &amp; then never really looked back. I realized my kind of hair just doesn\u2019t look good long. I came to understand and accept it. Then fast forward to March 2020, I got COVID (this was the first wave &amp; I had it pretty bad, SOB, O2 in the 80\u2019s, couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t lie flat so I had to sleep upright) fortunately after 10 days I got better. However, 3 months later my already thin hair took a hit. I was losing so much hair that I became depressed and didn\u2019t want to come out of my house. I had no idea how to fix it this time. It\u2019s going to be 2 years since my hair loss and my hair just isn\u2019t the same. Idk if my hair can even tolerate extensions. That\u2019s how fine it is, anything heavy just will not work. Idk what to do \ud83d\ude1e even cutting my hair short doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s significantly thinner with no volume. Before I would be able to air dry it and it would take on a nice wavy pattern which looked great on my short hair, but now it\u2019s just dull and lifeless. I have been taking vitamin D bc I did get my blood draw to make sure all was okay and that\u2019s the only thing that came back low. And I do use a rosemary oil but I never got sucked into buying anything else. I know this is my hair but I just need tips on what to do.",

            "body": "Hello! This might be a lot of advice but my friends consider me the girliest of girls so I can let you know my routine!  \n\n\nI think it's all about layering all the things that make me feel special.   \n\n\nFor me it begins in the shower with a body wash that I like the smell of. Then out of the shower it's a lotion or an oil. Layered soft fragrance always makes me feel more feminine if you aren't adverse to scent! A little essential fragrance oil (I like Jasmine and Gardenia) or perfume that compliments the previous scents is my next step. The perfumes that make me feel the most feminine are Baccarat Rouge 540 and Clinique's My Happy in Peace and Jasmine.  \n\n\nBeyond that even if I am going out early I find doing at least a bit of concealer and mascara and brow gel give me a bit of a polished look.  If you heat your lash curler and use it on your lashes with a good mascara (Waterproof is usually best as it sets the curl- I like the Better than Sex mascara by Too faced but I recently bought l'oreal lash paradise for 8 dollars and I honestly love it more).   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I am going out somewhere special it's a full face, soft glam looks are my favorite. The Anastasia Beverly Hills Soft Glam pallate is a good one to start playing around with. It's also  a good term to start if you want to learn some new techniques from Youtube!  \n\n\nAs for the hair- you can layer fragrance on that too- a shampoo and conditioner you like, some heat protectant spray, something for shine. I love the scent of Nature Lab Tokyo's shine spray . An up do with a few pieces framing my face is my quick look but I will often curl it with either a wand or rollers for a bouncy 90s glam look.  \n\n\nMy nails are done 95% of the time. Well kept nails defiantly contribute to the all over look. They don't have to be long, just neat and maintained. Some cute rings to draw attention to them are also a good move for a fem look. You don't need to put a lot of money into it if you learn to do them yourself!  \n\n\nAs for outfits- find your style and get into it- but earrings can elevate almost any look! Buy some purses you enjoy that match your outfits, it's something that only women typically carry so it does ad  a lot to the overall feeling. Heels or wedges always make me feel more girly, but sneakers can also work providing they compliment your look!",

I'm Asian, and I've always noticed some Asians have really good side profiles with eyes that look open, but others have eyes that don't look as open from the side profile (no judgement towards either!) What makes the eyes look different from the side profile for the two girls? And what makes the side profile have more depth? Is it because the second girl's face is smaller? Sometimes it seems like people have similar nose bridge heights, yet one clearly has a better depth to their side profile, so I am a bit confused, and couldn't find much, and why the two girls' side profiles look so different but I can't pinpoint the differences.

It was a huge change in climate, culture and also the type of job I had. I was working in cosmetics and always had a full beat. I am no longer in the industry and find that in the PNW less is more . About a year ago I have up liquid foundation as well . I use concealor for red spots and loose powder but I enjoy the glow my skin exudes without the foundation. It\u2019s also way easier to clean my face after a long day. I still love to do a full face for a night out As I find that one uniform color works best for that but as for daily I am enjoying the less is more sentiment! Would love to hear a thread on everyone\u2019s everyday glow/ easy makeup products !",
