            "body": "My holy grail was First Aid Beauty's Hello Fab Triple Protection Skin Tint. But its been discontinued. It had medium coverage and a natural finish. I have 3 left in my stash, but am already on the hunt for what will replace it when I'm out.... Ive tried a couple new ones so far and this is what Ive found:\n\nNote: I have normal/lightly oily on the t zone skin and I prefer a natural finish, not too matte, but also not dewy shiny. So my opinions are based on that. Also, I lightly brush a translucent setting powder on my face after using a tint to lock it in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlossier Skin Tint : Not enough coverage for my slight redness, and I'm not a fan of the dewy finish. This may be good for people with dry skin, that want minimal coverage. Also didn't stay on very long.\n\nit Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream with SPF 50+ : Medium/full coverage, less than a foundation but not too sheer. It doesn't have as natural of a finish as Id like, more on the dewy side (not not as dewy as the glossier tint). This product comes in an oil free matte version as well, but that one was too drying/matte for me. The matte one may be a good option for people with oilier skin. Random note : I work on commercial sets, and frequently ask MUAs what their favorite skin tint is, any of the 3 it Cosmetic tints are the most common ones they suggest.\n\nPhilosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar Skin Tint : Medium/light coverage. Silky texture with a natural finish. It feels like a moisturizer on your skin. I would say its good for almost all skin types, but if your skin is very oily, it may not stay put all day.\n\nNYX Professional Makeup Bare with Me Tinted Skin Veil : Light coverage, and I found it to be thick and oily on my skin. Probably good for people with dry skin and want light coverage. This was my least favorite as someone who likes a natural finish.\n\nNo7 Dual Action Tinted Moisturizer SPF 15 : Medium/light coverage. It was very hydrating but not oily. It didn't have staying power for my day though, so I returned this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are SO many skin tints/tinted moisturizers out there - I'm still on the search for something as good as what I had before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.self.com/gallery/best-bb-creams-tinted-moisturizers](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-bb-creams-tinted-moisturizers)[https://www.byrdie.com/best-drugstore-bb-creams-4165883](https://www.byrdie.com/best-drugstore-bb-creams-4165883)\n\nHeres some more recommended ones I haven't tried yet. I'm looking forward to trying the La Roche Posay and NARS ones from these websites recommendations.",
